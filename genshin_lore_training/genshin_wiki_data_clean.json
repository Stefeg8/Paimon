    "Abyssal_Corruption": "Abyssal Corruption           Abyssal corruption as seen on the Defiled Statue       Type   Lore       Region   Teyvat       Abyssal corruption  is a generic term for entities which have fallen under the  Abyss ' influence. Such entities have a negative effect on the world of  Teyvat .

As a result, surges of the Abyss' power have catastrophic consequences for Teyvat and humanity. The  cataclysm  500 years ago is currently the most notable surge of Abyssal power; it was caused by an attack by monsters of  Khaenri'ah , which were created from the Abyss' powers. [1] [2] [3]  Following the aftermath of Khaenri'ah's destruction, some of the humans-turned-monsters became members of the  Abyss Order , who are capable of spreading Abyssal corruption.  Prolonged contact with Abyssal corruption causes negative physical and mental consequences. Physical ailments include a worsening cough which will eventually result in coughing up blood and eventually, one's innards. [4]  Hallucinations, visions, and insanity have also resulted from contact with Abyssal corruption, [5]  and prolonged exposure can drastically alter a person's personality by exacerbating their desires. [4] [6]     Purification [ ]   Abyssal corruption can be purified or controlled through various means. Destroying sources of Abyssal corruption, depending on the entities' strength, can either permanently or temporarily halt their effects. The  Fatui  developed the Mokosh Device, a machine capable of clearing Abyssal corruption up to a certain degree. [7]   The power of  Celestia  can repel Abyssal corruption, and holding a connection to the  elements  — whether through bearing a  Vision  or some other means — provides greater resistance against the effects of Abyssal corruption.  Venti  visits the  Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero , which allegedly grew where  Vennessa  ascended to Celestia and holds the power of  Anemo , [8]  to recover from the Abyssal corruption which poisoned him when he attempted to break the curse over  Dvalin . [9]  In  The Chasm , the unearthing of a  Chasm Nail  fragment caused both the Abyssal  Dark Mud  and the mysterious  Lumenstones  and  Lumenspar  to begin growing en masse throughout the mines. [10]  The  Lumenstone Adjuvant , a particularly large Lumenstone which can be further enhanced by Lumenstones and Lumenspar, is capable of clearing out Dark Mud.  For reasons yet to be explained, the  Traveler  was capable of purifying the Abyssal corruption in one of Dvalin's teardrops; by comparison,  Lisa  felt a rejection from the tear that took the form of a sharp stinging sensation.    Notable Occurrences [ ]   The following are notable forms of Abyssal corruption which the Traveler has faced or has otherwise learned about.    Tainted Blood [ ]   Monsters from Khaenri'ah, most of which were created by the alchemist \"Gold\"  Rhinedottir , have blood tainted by the power of the Abyss. This otherworldly power can have lingering effects when spilled on Teyvat soil; after the demon  dragon   Durin  was slain over  Dragonspine , its blood seeped into the land and revitalized the  Frostbearing Tree , [11]  as well as crystallized into  Crimson Agate  which can then be offered to the tree and allow it to grow. This growth defies the power of the  Skyfrost Nail , which caused the land of Dragonspine to freeze over several thousand years ago and led to the collapse of the ancient civilization  Sal Vindagnyr . [12]   During his battle against Durin, Dvalin also ingested some of its blood after killing it with a fatal bite to its neck. The poisoned blood and the wounds he suffered over the course of the battle inflicted great suffering, which the Abyss Order took advantage of after his reawakening 500 years later to pit him against  Barbatos . When Barbatos, in the form of Venti, initially attempted to purify Dvalin, the Traveler and  Paimon  unintentionally interrupted them, causing the attempt to fail and getting Venti himself poisoned in turn. [9]     Defiled Statue [ ]   Main article:  Defiled Statue   The Defiled Statue is a  Statue of The Seven  in Barbatos' image, which was somehow plundered from  Mondstadt  by the Abyss Order as part of a project known as the Loom of Fate. The Abyss Order intended on using the Defiled Statue, the power of the ancient god  Osial , and the core of the  First Field Tiller  to create a weapon capable of destroying Celestia. Because of  Dainsleif  and the Traveler's intervention, this project is currently at a standstill, although the Defiled Statue's fate has been left unaddressed. [13]     Dark Mud [ ]   See also:  Dark Mud           Dark Mud       The discovery of a fragment of the Chasm Nail resulted in a surge of Abyssal corruption, primarily in the form of Dark Mud. The power of the Abyss in The Chasm appears to be at \"war\" with the power of Celestia, which also surged after the discovery of the fragment;  Khedive  likens humanity as being \"akin to beans on a stone mill, on the brink of a clash between two great powers. [...] we are presently being crushed by these two forces — one from above and one from below — and we shall soon be turned into bean paste!\" [4]   During the events of  Homecoming , it is revealed that the Dark Mud is actually a form of  forbidden knowledge  that was converted into its current form by the  Divine Nail  present in the area, which would remain unaffected by changes to  Irminsul . [14]   Later, when  Mualani  tells the Traveler about the disasters caused by the Abyss in  Natlan , she will tell that theThe  Children of Echoes ' territory was overrun by \"dangerous sludge surging from underground.\" It is not known, however, whether it is the same type of abyssal corruption or a different phenomenon.    Miasmic Tumor [ ]           The \"Miasmic Tumor\"       The  \"Miasmic Tumor\"  was the accumulation of filth absorbed by the  Sacred Sakura , which was created by  Raiden Makoto  and planted by  Raiden Ei  to dampen the effects of Khaenri'ah's attack during the cataclysm on  Inazuma . [15]   During the events of  Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual , the Traveler helps the shrine maiden  Hanachirusato  — who was actually a resurgence of filth herself, formed from the memories of the deceased  Kitsune Saiguu  — perform a major cleansing on the Sacred Sakura's roots and purge the \"Miasmic Tumor.\"    Trivia [ ]   During the commission  Big Pudgy Problem! , the Traveler finds a strange location with concentrated purple elemental dust. Dispersing the elemental dust causes a large number of  Slimes  to spawn, and Paimon afterwards remarks that there was \"something spooky about those weird elemental traces.\" While this elemental dust has not been linked to Abyssal corruption, purple has been strongly connected to the Abyss when used outside of the context of Electro.  This purple elemental dust is also seen on certain Statues of The Seven during the commissions  Grateful to the Gods , in which Slimes may spawn after dispersing the dust. The elemental dust is noted to be brimming with elemental energy and possibly contain something that Slimes are drawn to.   Etymology [ ]   The Mokosh Device ( Russian :  Система \"Мокошь\"  \"'Mokosh' System\" ), which the Fatui use to absorb and contain Abyssal corruption, is named after the Slavic goddess  Mokosh , a Mother Goddess and the protector of women's work and women's destinies.

    "Archon": "The Seven                        Details              Base   Celestia             The  Seven Archons , typically shortened to  The Seven , [1]  are the six  gods  and one  human [2]  who preside over the seven regions of  Teyvat , established after they or their predecessors emerged as the victors of the  Archon War  2,000 years ago. Each Archon is associated with an  element  and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment and determined their method of governance over their regions.  Each Archon possesses a magic focus called a  Gnosis , which allows them to resonate directly with  Celestia . [3]  By comparison,  Visions  are \"primitive\" — though a Gnosis's capabilities and purpose, beyond acting as a symbol of an Archon's status, remain unknown. Each Archon is bound to a Divine Throne, which is composed of a portion of the authority of one of the  Seven Sovereigns , and which grants them authority over the corresponding element. [4]   As of  Archon Quest   Chapter IV : Act V -  Masquerade of the Guilty , only six Divine Thrones remain. The Hydro Archon's Divine Throne was destroyed, returning the authority within to the  Hydro Dragon Sovereign  and breaking the established order of the Seven.

During this period of time, many gods and archons roamed the land, locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy. It appears that the battles associated with the Archon War are a multitude of local struggles that were grouped together by human history. For example, Barbatos became the first Anemo Archon among The Seven after the death of  Decarabian  2,600 years ago, [6]  while Morax is implied to have already become Geo Archon by the time the last of the original Seven claimed their title and thus brought an end to the War. [7]   The original Seven appeared to be relatively close, sharing a common duty of guiding humanity and often gathering in Liyue for drinks. However, over time, five of The Seven passed away, and some of the newer Archons no longer adhered to the duty of guiding humanity. [7]     The Cataclysm   500 years ago, the destruction of  Khaenri'ah  led to  forbidden knowledge  pollution and the rampage of  Rhinedottir 's creations, which held the power of the  Abyss  and ravaged the world of Teyvat. [8]  Among those who were perished in the ensuing conflicts were  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata ,  Raiden Makoto , and  Egeria . They were subsequently replaced by  Lesser Lord Kusanali ,  Raiden Ei , and  Focalors , respectively. The  Tsaritsa  was also greatly affected by the cataclysm, resulting in a drastic change in her personality.  The Seven were summoned to  Tunigi Hollow , where the worst outpouring of forbidden knowledge and monsters was occurring. During the battle, Egeria was killed and her body turned into the pool of water known as the Amrita. [9]  To preserve the water's purity and tether the god to the mortal realm, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the  Harvisptokhm  — which serves as a seal over the dark hollow and prevents the corruption from spreading further — from the Amrita. [10]  The  Oceanids , who served the former Hydro Archon but did not get along with Focalors, [11]  made their way to the Harvisptokhm in search of their master. Seeing that her current state was not what they had hoped for, [12]  they spread all over the continent and world itself. [13]   During this time, the Traveler and  their sibling  descended on Teyvat and, seeing the chaos, attempted to leave this world, only to run afoul of the  Unknown God . While the twins did not meet The Seven during this time, The Seven are aware of them and have been awaiting the Traveler's arrival. [14]   Around 400 years ago, [15]  Ei completed her research into creating a lifelike puppet,  the Shogun , to enforce her vision of Eternity over Inazuma while she retreated to the  Plane of Euthymia . [16]  Ever since then, the Shogun has been ruling Inazuma in her stead. Though Ei failed to make her puppets compatible with the Gnosis and thus gave it to  Yae Miko  instead, the Shogun is capable of tremendous feats even without it.    Powers and Abilities   An Archon's source of power has been attributed to three sources: the first is through presiding over their respective region, [1]  the second is from their people's faith in them and the third being a fragment of the Elemental Authority stolen by the Primordial One from the Seven Sovereign. [17]  Barbatos, who refuses to govern Mondstadt directly and has left Mondstadt for extended periods of time in the past, claims to be the weakest of The Seven as a result; Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was imprisoned in the  Sanctuary of Surasthana  and shunned by the sages since she was born 500 years ago, explains that her fighting skills are inferior to the  Traveler 's because she does not hold her people's faith.  The Seven appear to be privy to information that mortals are generally unaware of or deem to be merely fictional. Both Venti and Zhongli are aware of the existences of other worlds, as well as the fact that the Traveler had the power to travel between different worlds.    Elemental Control   Each Archon presides over their respective element and have used it to shape the landscape and climate of their respective territories. This ability seems to be held by any god and not only The Seven, but ever since the end of the Archon War, there have only been seven Archons at a time.  Unlike humans, who rely on resonance with a Vision to use the elements, the Archons seen so far were already affiliated with their elements before becoming Archons:  Barbatos  was originally a wind spirit who ascended to godhood, historical records regarding Morax address him as the \"God of Geo\" long before he became the Geo Archon, and Ei (and by proxy, Makoto) is an \"incarnation of lightning.\" [18]  Incarnations of Irminsul, i.e. Rukkhadevata and Nahida, are appointed guardians and maintainers of the tree of  Irminsul . Nahida was created using a branch of Irminsul, confirming the connection between Irminsul and Dendro.  Focalors  (and by extension,  Furina ) was an  Oceanid  who was transformed into a human by  Egeria  using the power of the  Primordial Sea , though Furina has since been converted into a full human. An Oceanid legend says that Egeria herself was created by the  Shade of Life  to take the place of \"the Primordial Sea's Heart\" after the  Hydro Dragon  was \"removed from that role.\"  While people on Teyvat commonly believe that the Archons grant Visions, [19]  they actually have no control over the distribution of Visions and are largely unaware of circumstances surrounding Visions. [20]  However, within her Plane of Euthymia, Ei could enact the \"Vision Hunt Decree\" effect to seal all characters' Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts besides the  Traveler 's. [21]  Because the Plane of Euthymia is Ei's personal dimension, there is not enough information to determine how this effect works or whether Ei is capable of enacting this anywhere else.    Gnoses   Main article:  Gnosis   While gnoses are described as being emblematic of an Archon's status and give them a direct connection to Celestia, their exact purpose and abilities remain a mystery. They evidently grant Archons a large power boost and the \"divine ability\" to defend their nations, [22]  and Zhongli attributes the ability to mint  Mora  as something that \"requires the use of the Geo Archon's power.\" [23]  The use of the gnoses' power is not exclusive to its respective Archon, as Nahida also utilized the power of the Electro Gnosis to aid in the healing of Irminsul.    Divine Throne   Each Divine Throne is composed of a portion of authority stolen from the Seven Sovereigns by the Heavenly Principles, and it is the Throne that grants each Archon their authority over the corresponding element, though what exactly this entails remains yet unknown. A great amount of power is required to destroy the Throne, and its destruction, resulting in the death of the Archon bound to the Throne, appears to be the only way to return the authority contained within to the Sovereign. [24]     Vessel Creation   On multiple occasions, Archons have fashioned humanoid vessels using their powers as an Archon, perhaps through the use of their Gnoses. Venti's vessel was his first use of his newfound divine power after ascending to godhood as the Anemo Archon. [25]   Zhongli 's body was likely created through this method as well, as he states that his \"structure is not the same as that of normal people.\" [26]  After becoming the first Electro Archon, Makoto \"reforged\" Ei's body after Ei gave up her bodily form so Makoto could ascend to the \"heavenly citadel.\" [27]   Although gods are immortal, their physical vessels — including those made with the power of an Archon — have finite lifespans and can be \"killed,\" while their consciousness can fade away. [28]  By the time of the main story, five of the original Seven have died and been replaced. While pondering how she would overcome her physical lifespan, Ei stumbled on a method of creating synthetic puppets indistinguishable from true life, which she used to create  Scaramouche  and  the Shogun . After giving her Gnosis to  Yae Miko  for safekeeping, Ei discarded her physical form, the Shogun warning her that there was no return from giving up her body. [29]  Due to no longer having a physical body, Ei is only able to manifest herself outside of her Plane of Euthymia by using the body of the puppet as her own. [30]   Vessels created through an Archon's power have another major weakness: they are incapable of being healed through ordinary means, including a Vision-bearer's healing abilities. [3]  Venti harnesses the power of the  Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero  twice to heal himself; first was to expunge the  abyssal  magic that poisoned him via  Dvalin  when the Traveler unintentionally interrupted them, [31]  and the second was to recover after having his Gnosis taken by Signora. [3]  The exact properties this tree holds is unclear, but it may have a connection to Celestia: according to legend, it grew from the spot where Vennessa ascended to Celestia.  It's important to note that vessels can be the Archons themselves and not different entities. This page specifically refers to a human body created by Archons to live among the people of Teyvat as vessel creation is not exclusive to the Archons, in fact most gods are capable of this feat.

Erased  is only used for those who are  removed from Irminsul .     ↑   Despite being over 6,000 years old, Morax was only considered the Geo Archon after claiming one of the seats among The Seven. When exactly that occurred is unknown, although  Character Story 5  indicates he was not the last to ascend.     ↑  3.0   3.1   Although Baal is used to collectively refer to both Makoto and Ei,  Wishes  indicates that the name Baal belongs to Makoto and did not belong to Ei. As such, where applicable, Baal is considered to only be Makoto's name.     ↑   Although Makoto and Ei won the Archon War together, Ei is not considered one of the original Seven. In addition, according to  Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi , after the two won the Archon War, Ei sacrificed her body so Makoto could ascend and become the Electro Archon. Afterwards, Makoto recalled her spirit and recreated her body.     ↑   Lesser Lord Kusanali is now believed to have always been the Dendro Archon as a consequence of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's existence being  removed  from Irminsul.     ↑   The Hydro Archon's Divine Throne was destroyed along with Focalors during  Chapter IV . As a result, there will be no further Hydro Archons.     ↑   Furina  is not considered an Archon, as she did not carry any of the divinity of Focalors, possessing neither gnosis nor Divine Throne, and was fully human. This is further indicated by the conversation between Focalors and Furina shown in  The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur , in which Focalors tasks Furina with pretending to be a god without being or attempting to become one. Despite the urgency and great importance of Furina's task, Focalors did not provide Furina with anything that would help make Furina's false identity more convincing, which suggests that Focalors could not provide for Furina, and Furina did not possess, any true information or power that would allow Furina to lay an even partially truthful claim to the role of Hydro Archon.     ↑   After separating out her divinity and memories, Focalors named the human she left behind \"Furina.\" It is not known where this name comes from, but Focalors saw Furina as essentially a human version of Focalors as well as exactly the kind of human Focalors wished to be.     ↑   In  Masquerade of the Guilty , Focalors states that Egeria's justice was \"existence,\" and that Focalors's justice was the \"continuation\" of that existence. Both gods are Gods of Justice.     ↑   The Archon of Natlan is not a god, but is instead a mortal granted the authority of the divine throne by the intervention of the Ruler of Death,  Ronova , following the defeat of the Pyro Sovereign  Xiuhcoatl  at the hands of Xbalanque. According to Mavuika, a mortal who ascends to the divine throne has their \"inner flame\" awakened upon doing so, and receives power and knowledge equivalent to a god.     ↑   Mavuika was ascended during the  Cataclysm  but placed her life in the Sacred Flame to be resurrected 500 years ago to the present day. She mentions that a human life depends on burning Sacred Flame, meaning she lives as long as the Sacred Flame keeps burning.     ↑  12.0   12.1   Venti refers to the Pyro Archon as the \"Lady of Fire\" when meeting  Vennessa  1,000 years ago.     ↑  13.0   13.1   As the  Pyro Archon  position is inherited by mortals through winning the pilgrimage, they remain subject to mortality. It can safely be assumed that all Pyro Archons lived normal human lifespans and are currently deceased.     ↑   In  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail , Dainsleif suggests the Tsaritsa's ideal was originally Love. However, he refers to it in past tense, while Zhongli avoids speaking about it during  Downtown , leaving it unconfirmed.     ↑   The Tsaritsa was likely the Cryo Archon 500 years ago based on Venti's description of her in  Ending Note .       Representatives   Some members of The Seven have worked through proxies who were not Archons but appeared to be so to the people of Teyvat. These include the following characters:        Nation    Representative    Archon    Start (Years Ago) [a]     End (Years Ago) [a]       Inazuma     Ei     Makoto     2,000+ [b]     500 [c]       The Shogun     Ei     400 [15] [16]     In service [d]       Fontaine     Furina     Focalors     500    Masquerade of the Guilty [e]       Notes     ↑  1.0   1.1   Due to the passage of time in-universe from the beginning of  Genshin Impact , all exact figures are rounded to the nearest century.     ↑   Makoto and Ei ruled together and appeared to be a single Electro Archon to the people of Inazuma, with Ei serving as Makoto's  kagemusha .     ↑   While the people of Inazuma are unaware of this change, Ei became an Archon herself after Makoto's death during the  cataclysm , thus ending her period of service as a non-Archon.     ↑   Although the Shogun and Ei began to co-rule Inazuma after the events of  Radiant Sakura , only a select few are privy to the Shogun's existence as a separate entity from Ei.     ↑   After Furina's identity was exposed along with Focalors's execution, Furina abdicated the position of Hydro Archon to live as an ordinary Fontainian.       Trivia   When casting Elemental Skills and Bursts, the ends of an Archon's hair glow brightly with their element's color.   Though the only two remaining Archons of the original Seven are Barbatos and Morax, Beelzebul — the current Electro Archon — was also a veteran of the Archon War, with her sister Baal taking the original Electro seat. It is not yet known if any of the other current Archons were active during the Archon War.  During the  Archon Quest   Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies  in  Chapter III : Act V -  Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises , Greater Lord Rukkhadevata is erased from Irminsul, becoming forgotten by all of Teyvat except for the Traveler. In the new history that results from this action, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's existence is replaced by that of Lesser Lord Kusanali; it is now believed that she has been the Dendro Archon since the end of the Archon War — therefore being one of the original Seven — and became imprisoned by the sages of Sumeru after losing her memories during the cataclysm.   Currently, there is a running gag [46]  in which the Archons encountered have no Mora:  Barbatos, as Venti, has those listening to him buy him drinks instead of giving him Mora. [47]  He also pilfers from the  Dawn Winery  to eat [48]  and as soon as he has something that is spendable, he thinks of spending it on drinks. [49]  His occupation as a bard is also not lucrative in the first place. [50]   Morax did not pay attention to price tags prior to beginning life as Zhongli, because he could make Mora as needed with his Gnosis. [51]  As a result, Zhongli easily spends (or agrees to spend) large amounts of Mora, generally having others pay for his expenses. He also did not think of setting aside some Mora for personal use before relinquishing his Gnosis. [51]   Beelzebul has no need for Mora, as she simply asks the  Tri-Commission  to bring the items to her.   Buer has not mentioned any struggles with Mora in her dialogue, but she struggles to place a hypothetical price tag on the  Sanctuary of Surasthana  despite ruminating over it for a long time, [52]  implying that she struggles to comprehend values that would equate to large amounts of Mora. This is likely due to her 500-year imprisonment in the  Sanctuary of Surasthana , where she received information and items for free via the Akasha and sages, respectively. [53]   Although Furina is not an Archon, she partially continues the running gag, as she is considered unemployed following the  Archon Quest   Chapter IV : Act V -  Masquerade of the Guilty .  While  Neuvillette  has made arrangements to ensure Furina will not have material issues, [54]  she decides to live alone in a small apartment, where she struggles with cooking and ends up only eating macaroni with different sauces. [55]   Furina herself does have a substantial amount of Mora, as she saved the Mora she earned over the last few centuries in a \"private reserve.\" She now uses this Mora as an ordinary Fontainian, though she tends to overspend. [56]  This may be a direct callback to Zhongli's failure to set aside some \"private funds\" for himself and how particularly disastrous it can be when he habitually agrees to transactions involving large amounts of Mora.   Etymology   The term \" archon \" is a Greek word that refers to \"A person who claims the right to rule, or to exercise power or sovereign authority over other human beings.\"  Genshin Impact  uses its  Gnostic  usage, [57]  in which the  archons  are seven supernatural beings who each rule over one of the  seven planets . They are subservient to the  demiurge , the creator of the material universe who is beneath the  Monad , the true God. By reaching  gnosis , an understanding of divine knowledge, one can transcend the confines of the material world and escape the dominion of the archons.  A miHoYo developer interview on the May 2021 edition of the Japanese entertainment magazine PASH states that Gnosticism was selected as the primary mythological basis for  Genshin Impact , particularly in regards to how Gnosticism deals with the relationship between man and world, and how the archons influence the world. [57]   Several Archons have their Goetic names directly derived from one of the 72 demons found in the  Ars Goetia , one of the books in  The Lesser Key of Solomon . Gods who predate The Seven have varying levels of similarity to a demon name in the  Ars Goetia  (see  Gods § Etymology ).  Barbatos  is one of the dukes of Hell.   Morax  is a president of Hell.   Baal  is the first king of Hell.  Although  Beelzebul , Ei's alternate name, is not used in the  Ars Goetia , it is associated with Baal. Ei herself has continued to rule under the name \"Baal.\"   Buer  is a Great President of Hell.   Haborym  is another name for Aym, a Great Duke of Hell.   Unlike the other named Archons, Focalors is not a direct lift; instead, it is a derivation of  Focalor , a Great Duke of Hell.   Gallery   Venti, Ei, and Zhongli with Aether, Lumine, and Paimon.

    "Delusion": "This article is about the object. For the Archon Quest in Chapter II: Act III, see  Delusion (Quest) .       Delusion           A  Fatui Pyro Agent 's Delusion       Type   Lore       Delusions  are powerful,  Vision -like objects produced by the  Fatui . Their production method and the number in circulation is unknown, but it appears to utilize the remains of deceased  gods  and other powerful beings. Like Visions, Delusions grant their wielders the ability to manipulate certain  elements , but unlike Visions, they can be used by anyone, and are also supposedly far more powerful than Visions. [1]  However, Delusions have immense and potentially lethal drawbacks in exchange for their power, possibly draining the user's vitality [2]  or backfiring on them. [3]   Knowledge about Delusions is scarce and it is a closely-guarded secret even among the Fatui. According to the Fatui member  Viktor , few members beyond the  Eleven Fatui Harbingers  possess one, and they are personally granted by the  Tsaritsa  herself. [1]  In recent years, Fatui agents have secretly been distributing mass-produced Delusions amongst commoners of the seven nations.

Based on current knowledge, Delusions utilize the remains of ancient  gods  and other powerful entities; the Delusions produced at  Yashiori Island 's  Delusion Factory  used  Crystal Marrow , which contains the  Tatarigami  curse originating from the slain god  Orobashi . [4]  The Delusion used by  Crepus  and  Diluc  in the  Manga  was created alongside  Barnabas ' experiments on directly injecting archon residue — the remains of ancient gods [Note 1]  — into human subjects like  Collei . [5] [6] [Note 2]   A Delusion's abilities seem to depend on the type used. Ones used by the Fatui largely contain elemental powers and allow their users some degree of elemental manipulation abilities. The archon residue imbued in Collei and in Crepus and Diluc's Delusion is considered as having a \"neutral\" element despite manifesting as black fire, as their effects do not resemble that of any known element. During the investigation into the Black Fire incident she caused, Collei's fire was described as having a \"great hunger for anything living,\" and people who touched it were \"devoured\" and all that was left of them were \"charred remains.\" [7]   The  Knights of Favonius  conducted some research on Delusions following the incident resulting in Crepus' death, although their documents on them were partially destroyed by fire. The little information  Jean ,  Lisa , and  Amber  could salvage from the tattered documents revealed that Delusions emit the smell of  Mist Grass  upon use. [8]     Side Effects [ ]   Delusions are extremely powerful, but potentially equally dangerous for their user: Crepus was either killed by using one, [3]  or left in such agony that Diluc chose to take his life to spare him the suffering. [9]  Some members of the  Watatsumi Army  who used Delusions suffered from rapid aging as a result of their vitality being drained, with some like  Teppei  dying from its effects. [2]   The side effects of Delusion usage seem to vary from person-to-person. Crepus and Teppei died relatively shortly after taking up the Delusion, while Diluc used Crepus' Delusion for three years without any obvious consequences. The Delusion-users among the Resistance were unequally affected, but there is too little information to draw any conclusion on why that was so.  Too little is known about Fatui personnel to tell whether they suffer from the same Delusion side effects as non-Fatui users. Neither  Childe  nor  Signora  have displayed any physical drawbacks from using their Delusions, although neither are ordinary humans and so there are many potential reasons as to why. Childe has only been seen suffering the repercussions of using his Delusion in conjunction with the Abyss technique  Foul Legacy Transformation . Signora's Delusion is explicitly different from most other Delusions, as she had previously transformed her body with the art of living flame and her Cryo Delusion — created with the Tsaritsa's \"grace\" — prevents it from consuming and killing her. [10] [11]   However, it has been suggested that Signora's Delusion warped her already-unstable mind. Signora's memories of her past were suppressed upon gaining her Delusion, [12]  and the \"delusion\"  Pierro  gave her when he did so convinced her to join the Fatui. [10] [13]     Types of Delusions [ ]   Crepus' Delusion [ ]           The Delusion, or \"Evil Eye,\" in Crepus' possession.       In the  manga , the Delusion in Crepus' possession takes the form of a red orb fitted onto a left-handed glove with a ring on the middle finger. The symbol inside the orb is not an elemental symbol or the Fatui emblem, but is instead a large circle with another smaller circle towards the bottom. When activated, it forms barbed chains that sprout from the palm of the glove, allowing them to grapple even large and powerful creatures like  Ursa the Drake . These chains can also be conjured from magic circles, allowing more chains to be produced at once. [14] [15]   These chains can optionally be surrounded by black fire, as seen when Crepus used it to fight Ursa the Drake. When Diluc uses it to apprehend  Krupp , the black fire is not present, [16]  but it reappears when he fights the Fatui personnel while posing as the perpetrator of the Black Fire incident.    Mass-Produced Delusions [ ]   The mass-produced Delusion confiscated by  Gorou  is a round glass orb with the Fatui insignia inlaid in it, encased in a jagged-edge frame. When Gorou displays it, the orb appears black while the Fatui emblem takes on a light gray color. [2]  Because no member of the Watatsumi Army is seen using a Delusion's power on-screen, it is currently impossible to discern how their Delusions' abilities manifested. Teppei, who used a mass-produced Delusion and never received a Vision, guessed that using a Vision would be similar. [2]   The Delusions used by Agents, Cicin Mages, Mirror Maidens, and Operatives are visually identical to those distributed to the Watatsumi Army, although their orbs are colored based on the elemental abilities they bestow. Childe's Vision, and by extension his Electro Delusion, uses the same casing as mass-produced Delusions, although the true form of his Delusion has been obfuscated (see below).    Childe's Delusion [ ]           Childe - Delusion Unleashed phase       Childe's Delusion appears to change forms, making it difficult to discern its true appearance. Pierro \"pinned\" it on him when he became a Harbinger, [17]  but Childe's regular character model has nothing that looks like his Electro Delusion. Instead, his Hydro Vision is held in the same casing used to encase mass-produced Delusions. When Childe enters the Delusion Unleashed phase of  Enter the Golden House , the Hydro Vision on his belt appears to be supplanted by his Electro Delusion: The orb turns Electro purple and bears a Fatui symbol instead of the Hydro symbol. His clothing also changes color, although it is unclear whether that is directly related to his Delusion or not.              Childe's Delusion in his Foul Legacy Transformation       In his Foul Legacy phase, his Vision and Delusion change places again and he is capable of wielding both elements at the same time. The positions of his Vision and the badge along his right shoulder swap places; his Vision, bearing the Hydro symbol once again, can be seen on his shoulder, while the badge — which had no elemental color or symbol up until this point — moves down to his belt and bears the Fatui emblem with Electro purple colors.      Signora's Delusion [ ]   The appearance of Signora's Delusion is unconfirmed and she does not wear anything resembling an orb-type Delusion. Hers is also unique, in that her Delusion was bestowed to suppress her flame-based power rather than amplify it. [11]   Based on her animations during the  Narukami Island: Tenshukaku  fight, the catalyst-like object that floats around her is probably her Delusion. At the start of battle, she uses it to activate the Cryo snowflake-like field under her feet, within which she could create icy blades while surrounded by a barrier. While preparing her transformation, she dispels the barrier and briefly remanifests the catalyst above her head before immediately using it to encase herself in an ice cocoon. After completing her transformation into her Crimson Witch of Embers phase, the catalyst cannot be seen on her, but it returns after she is defeated and she returns to her normal appearance. [18]       Arlecchino's Delusion [ ]             Arlecchino's Delusion visible during her Story Quest cutscene       Arlecchino has a Pyro Vision attached to her back under her ponytail. During Phase 2 of  The Knave  boss fight, she replaces it with a Pyro Delusion.

While the exact circumstances behind how he obtained it is unclear, it seems to have been part of an overarching plot by  Il Dottore 's subordinates, which may include Krupp and Barnabas. Crepus planned on gifting to Diluc on his eighteenth birthday, but with Diluc's preternatural skills, Crepus deemed it unnecessary. When the Fatui lured Ursa the Drake to attack them on their way back to the Dawn Winery, Crepus wielded it to save Diluc, but its power backfired and left him in incredible agony. [21]  In the manga, Crepus disintegrates and disappears; however, Kaeya's  character story  says Diluc put Crepus out of his misery by killing him. It is unknown which rendition is the truth.  Diluc ended up taking the Delusion for himself, [16]  and departed from  Mondstadt  to search for the Delusion's origins. He eventually traced it back to the Fatui and likely used the Delusion to fight them during his three-year journey across  Teyvat . For reasons not fully known, the Delusion never backfired on Diluc, but it may be because Diluc was a Vision bearer while Crepus was not.  Kaeya  also learned about the Delusion, although he wouldn't be made aware of its origins until investigating the Black Fire Incident.  Upon Diluc's return to Mondstadt, he used it to ambush Krupp during the party at the Dawn Winery. Dottore silenced Krupp using an unknown weapon but decided not to make the incident public after taking an interest in Diluc's Delusion, which he calls a \"Vision.\" [16]  He was likely unaware of the Delusion's nature, given his general apathy towards his subordinates' actions until they provide results that pique his interest.  Following the Black Fire Incident and the discovery of the link between the Delusion and Collei's archon residue powers, Diluc and Kaeya concocted a plan to derail the Fatui's plans. Taking advantage of the shared origins between the Delusion and Collei's black fire, Diluc posed as the perpetrator of the incident to lure the Fatui guards away from Collei, the actual perpetrator. [14]   While Barnabas was not fooled and quickly caught up with Amber and Collei, Diluc arrived late into the fight and pinned him down with the Delusion's powers as Amber delivered the incapacitating blow. Before losing consciousness, Barnabas expressed his surprise upon seeing that Diluc was wielding the Delusion. Kaeya and the Fatui guards arrived on the scene and \"captured\" Diluc to bring him back to Dottore. However, Diluc escaped and sent Dottore the broken delusion, much to the Harbinger's consternation. [22]     In-Game [ ]   When Signora attacks  Venti  and the  Traveler , she creates a blizzard capable of instantly freezing Venti's legs. This is later shown to originate from a Cryo Delusion, given to her to suppress her Pyro abilities as the  Crimson Witch of Flames . She would continue using it during the  Duel Before the Throne .  During the  Golden House battle , Childe uses his Delusion. His Delusion's element is Electro, indicating that Delusions are not bound to its user's Vision element, if they have one.  While investigating claims of accelerated aging among the soldiers of the resistance, Gorou manages to seize the \"secret weapon\" they were using and shows it to the Traveler, who immediately recognizes it as a Delusion. Due to the  Sakoku Decree , the Fatui had been making the Delusions in Inazuma by utilizing Crystal Marrow, supplied by the  Kanjou Commission . The factory is later raided and razed by the resistance.  Yelena , a renegade Fatuus, took her Delusion with her when she and her brother  Kirya  defected and fled to  Sumeru .  After studying perfumery, the siblings eventually went to  Fontaine , where Yelena worked with Edgar,  Sylvain  and  Lucien , by using the Delusion to cultivate flowers with the distorted elemental energy, to create the \"Auguste\" perfume, which was so popular that it sold for as much as 10 million Mora per bottle. However, extended usage of the Delusion rapidly aged Yelena, and the traces of elemental energy from the Delusion had a chance of harming anyone who is particularly sensitive to it; Sylvian believed that the harmful effects were so negligible that he forced Yelena to continue to cultivate more flowers to they do not miss out on profits, rejecting her concerns of bringing a potentially harmful product into market. To hide her accelerated aging, Yelena wore heavy makeup and scarcely showed herself to Kirya in favor of her work.  Their hasty actions would eventually led the  Marechaussee Phantom  to investigate on price fixing. Fearing the investigation could lead to her and her brother's connections to the Fatui be discovered and the secrets of the Auguste's harmful background, but being too weakened by the Delusion's side effects to escape, Yelena committed suicide by self-immolation, incinerating all the Auguste flowerbeds to destroy all incriminating evidence. However, Kirya got a hold of the Delusion, and used it, along with the Auguste profits that Yelena left him, to enact his revenge against the three marketeers, whom he blames for his sister's death.   Kirya used the Delusion to continue to cultivate the flowers, which aged him greatly, to around Edgar's age. He used this to his advantage, by killing Edgar, so he could take the man's identity for the next twenty years and plot revenge against the other two. Upon successfully assassinating Lucien, and forcing Sylvian to confess their conspiracy of creating the Auguste, Kirya, still under his Edgar guise, feigned insistence that he and Sylvian should return to Fontaine to face justice. But the night before their extradition, Kirya tried to poison Sylvian and then fled, by using the Delusion to give him the strength that his weakened body could not on its own. After fleeing to his hideout where he was cultivating the flowers, Kirya was so weakened by the usage of the Delusion that he dropped it as he prepared to commit suicide, which  Emilie  and the Traveler stopped him from doing.    Trivia [ ]   The Chinese name for Delusions,  邪眼   Xié Yǎn , \"Evil Eye,\"  is a nod to their name for Visions ( Chinese :  神之眼   Shén zhī Yǎn , \"Eye of God\" ).  Similarly, in English, the term \"vision\" can be used for both the literal ability to see, as well as the experience of a divine or otherwise supernatural appearance. A \"delusion,\" meanwhile, is a false belief that is propagated even in the face of facts, or the state of being deluded.   Delusions are obtainable items in the form of the  Operative's Constancy , a  Character and Weapon Enhancement Material  dropped by  Fatui Operatives .

The Knights could not have written the document since the syringe's side was written in an ancient language which none of them could read, which makes it a Fatui document by process of elimination.

    "Descender": "Descender     Type   Lore       Region   Teyvat       \" Descender \" is a term used by various figures in  Genshin Impact , such as the  Fatui , for outlanders who come from outside the world of  Teyvat . Historical figures and documents suggest that the epithet of \"Descender\" is used only for those who prove capable of transcending Teyvat's \"laws,\" and is not a blanket term for all external beings.  The  Traveler  is known as the Fourth Descender, and  Lesser Lord Kusanali  presumes that the  Heavenly Principles  is the First. [1]     Contents     1   Overview   2   Known Descenders     2.1   Possible Descenders       3   Other External Beings   4   Trivia   5   Notes   6   Other Languages   7   Change History   8   References   9   Navigation       Overview [ ]   The origins of the term \"Descender\" are unclear, but it may stem from  Khaenri'ahn  parlance given that it is used by the  Eleven Fatui Harbingers [1]  (co-founded by  Pierro , a former Khaenri'ahn royal mage), [2]  and independently by  Rene  based on his research on various ancient nations, including Khaenri'ah. [3]  Very few people in Teyvat know the term or whom it encompasses; for example,  Nahida , an  Archon  with a direct connection to  Irminsul , first learned about it from  The Doctor  as part of his information trade for the Dendro  Gnosis . [1]   Because Descenders come from outside Teyvat, they are not bound to the world's laws and are unaffected by circumstances that affect beings from this world. Furthermore, information and memories about them will not be recorded in Irminsul, which only collects information about Teyvat. [1]  Conversely, their memories are not changed when Irminsul is tampered with, when that normally affects not only people's memories, but also non-sentient items such as books, and even in-game descriptions such as Character Stories. For example, the Traveler remembers  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata  after all traces of her existence were erased from Irminsul and thus, from history and memory itself. [4]  They also remember  Scaramouche  after he removes his names from Irminsul, while  Nahida  and  Paimon  both forget him. [2] [5]   Rene's research with the  Narzissenkreuz Ordo , largely derived from ancient Khaenri'ahn,  Remurian , and  Sumeru  sources, led to his conclusion that Descenders have \"wills that can rival an entire world,\" and not all who come from outside of Teyvat are necessarily Descenders. [3]  Similarly, the allegedly Khaenri'ahn  Perinheri  claims that the Khaenri'ah awaited the \"arrival of beings who could transcend the gods\" from among those who came from \"outside this world,\" but that such a person never appeared during Perinheri's time.  Following the revelation that the Third Descender's remains were used to make the Gnoses, which can enhance elemental abilities, Paimon and the Traveler speculate that an inherent affinity for elemental power may be a shared trait among Descenders. [6]  The Heavenly Principles, meanwhile, was able to take the  Seven Sovereigns ' elemental Authorities for itself. [7]   After learning about the concept of Descenders, the  Fontainian -born Rene aspired to become one in order to become powerful enough to save Fontainians from the impending  prophecy of Fontaine . However, his attempts failed twice, [8] [9]  and the Traveler's intervention in Fontaine is what ultimately averts the prophecy. [10]  Based on current knowledge, there is no evidence that people born in Teyvat can become Descenders.    Known Descenders [ ]   First Descender:  Heavenly Principles  (unconfirmed) [1]   Third Descender: Unknown (deceased) [6]   Fourth Descender:  Traveler [1]   Possible Descenders [ ]   Several historical figures who have come from outside Teyvat have been mentioned via books and in-game descriptions, but have not been definitely confirmed as one of the other three Descenders.  The  Primordial One  mentioned in  Before Sun and Moon  matches  Apep 's description of the Heavenly Principles [11]  and Neuvillette's description of the \"First Usurper.\" [12]  This entity came from outside of Teyvat, took power from the  Seven Sovereigns , suppressed the old order, and established the world in its current state. [13]  An unknown amount of time ago, the Heavenly Principles and \"one who came after\" [14]  used the Third Descender's remains to create the  Gnoses . [6]   Before Sun and Moon  also mentions the  Second Who Came , or the \"second throne of the heavens,\" who was the next entity to come from beyond this world. They waged war against the Primordial One, which wreaked massive destruction throughout the world and caused  Enkanomiya  to sink underwater. However, the book's author surmises the Second Who Came lost, attributing the Enkanomiyans' inability to return to the surface to the Primordial One's power. [13]     Other External Beings [ ]   Little is known about beings external to Teyvat, and because information about Descenders was initially conflated with information about all outlanders, the following information is extrapolated from known examples of non-Descender outlanders.  Unlike Descenders, \"regular\" outlanders cannot change Teyvat's fate and cannot transcend the gods, specifically the Heavenly Principles and  Celestia . Khaenri'ahns may have developed a method for distinguishing Descenders from ordinary outlanders, [15]  but depending on the circumstances surrounding the  Traveler's sibling , this method may be fallible. [16] [Note 1]   Notably, the Traveler's sibling is  not  presently considered a Descender. [1]  500 years ago, they were touted as the one who would \"bring new strength and hope to Khaenri'ah,\" but things went awry and resulted in the  cataclysm , which ultimately doomed the kingdom. [16]  Furthermore, their travels throughout Teyvat following the fall of Khaenri'ah have been recorded in Irminsul, leading Nahida to conclude that they originate from Teyvat; the Traveler suspects that either their memories are wrong, or \"this world\" has done something to their sibling. [1]  Scaramouche later divulges that Khaenri'ah might be the reason why records of the Sibling exist in Irminsul. [2]   The  All-Devouring Narwhal  was brought to Teyvat by  Surtalogi  as a pet and eventually became a vehicle for the prophecy of Fontaine in the present day. Its consumption of the  Primordial Sea 's waters and subsequent defeat at the Traveler and  Neuvillette 's hands caused the prophesied flood, although the predicted dissolution of all Fontainians was averted due to Neuvillette's intervention. [17] [18]   While  Aloy  is technically from another world and her Collected Miscellany calls her the first outlander Alice has seen \"in centuries,\" [19]  as a collaboration character, she has not been integrated into the  Genshin Impact  storyline.     Trivia [ ]   Other powerful individuals have exhibited qualities shared by Descenders and outlanders, but their origins currently remain unclear:  Alice  is an \"unaging,\" [20] [Note 2]  nigh-omnipotent witch capable of traveling to, and bringing back mementos from, other worlds. [21] [22]  She also narrates  Aloy  and  Wanderer 's  Collected Miscellanies  in  Dainsleif 's place; Aloy does not come from this world and Wanderer erased himself from Irminsul, suggesting that Dainsleif cannot comment on their abilities but Alice can.  Alice's Descender-like qualities may be related to her duty of guarding Teyvat's \"borders.\" [23]  It also allows her to \"see this world and everything that lives in it from a lot of different perspectives\" and also grants her \"special privileges,\" which she mentions in the context of Teyvat's \"rules\" but does not elaborate on. [24]   Nicole Reeyn , another member of the  Hexenzirkel  like Alice, is far older than the hundreds-of-years-old  Barbeloth  and appears to be immune to changes in Irminsul, or at least aware that changes to Irminsul were made. [25]   Notes [ ]     ↑   Chlothar 's words to the Traveler's sibling and the conferment of a royal title on them have been interpreted to mean that Khaenri'ahns believed them to be a long-awaited Descender.     ↑   Given that Venti narrated his encounter with Alice and Klee as if it were a two-line story, it is unclear if Venti meant \"unaging\" in a literal sense or if he used the word for illustrative purposes.

These nails contain immense power and are capable of affecting the  Ley Lines  in the areas where they are located. [2]   According to various legends, they were cast down by  the heavens  to heal the land following the war between the  Heavenly Principles  and the  Second Who Came , but they also devastated the mortal realm.

At the top of the nail is a  celestial motif .  At  Dragonspine  and  The Chasm , people who have undertaken research into the areas' strange environments have noted peculiarities of similar qualities, which relate back to the power of the divine nails. Dragonspine, which was once a lush mountain, has blue plants that proliferate around  Ancient Rime . [5]  The Chasm, which is known for its ore, began spawning  Lumenstone  and  Lumenspar  after a fragment of its divine nail was discovered in one of the underground mines' caves. [6]  These stones are capable of repelling  Dark Mud , an Abyssal power, which also began emerging en masse after the discovery of the nail fragment. According to  Nahida , the divine nails have the ability to purify and stabilize powers that shouldn't exist in Teyvat, such as  forbidden knowledge . [7]   Upon impact with the ground, the nail leaves behind a large crater in its wake, as shown in the area surrounding the Chasm's  Spiritstone  and the depression in the center of  Mt. Damavand . Divine nails often cause extreme weather changes in the places they land, such as Dragonspine becoming a snowy mountain,  Tsurumi Island  being covered in fog, and the  Desert of Hadramaveth  developing raging sandstorms.    Story [ ]   Thousands of years ago, the Heavenly Principles' war against the Second Who Came brought great destruction to heaven and earth. [8] [9]  In the aftermath, the heavens cast down the divine nails to mend the land and suppress the \"dark poison\" — highly implied to relate to the secrets of the skies, forbidden knowledge, and the  Abyss  — that the invaders had brought. However, this also had devastating effects on civilizations that still existed on the mortal realm. [3] [4]     Dragonspine [ ]   Sal Vindagnyr , located on the mountain now known as Dragonspine, was once a lush and verdant area with a prominent  Irminsul  tree which the people revered. When the  Skyfrost Nail  descended, it landed over a ritual site at the summit of the mountain, now known as the  Peak of Vindagnyr . [10]  It drastically transformed the area's climate and also shattered the Irminsul tree, which the  Princess of Sal Vindagnyr  attempted to revive via grafting but failed to accomplish. [2] [11]  For unknown reasons, the Skyfrost Nail splintered into shards which then scattered to three places around Dragonspine, one of which was the Irminsul tree — which later became the  Frostbearing Tree .  Around a thousand years ago, towards the end of the  Mondstadt Aristocracy  era, a group of nobles attempted to restore their prestige by arranging an expedition to uncover Dragonspine's secrets. However, this expedition was sabotaged by  Eberhart , who wished to overthrow the aristocracy, and none of its members made it back to Mondstadt. [12] [13]   By the time the  Traveler  explores Dragonspine, nobody had yet reached the summit on account of the  Ancient Rime  that blocked the paths to the summit. During  World Quest   In the Mountains , the Traveler frees the three shards from their icy encasements, which causes them to return to the main nail fragment at the summit. After the nail is fully restored, it ascends into the sky above the Peak of Vindagnyr.    The Chasm [ ]   The divine nail in the Chasm is known as the Spiritstone and has a connection to the  Solar Chariot , also known as the \"heavenly star\" legend to the people of  Liyue . [6]  Little is revealed regarding the ancient civilization in the depths of The Chasm besides the fact that it is older than  Khaenri'ah . [14]   In recent times, a fragment of the Spiritstone was discovered in  Stony Halls , where miners who came in contact with it would begin having hallucinations in which their desires were granted, leading to this crystal to be dubbed the \"Wishstone.\" Lumenstone and Lumenspar also began appearing en masse, while the physical structure of The Chasm's mines began changing as though it was alive. Alarmed by these turns of events, the  Liyue Qixing  ordered the closure of The Chasm and made an agreement with the  Fatui  to investigate the cause. [15]  Following the events of  Archon Quest   Chapter I , this agreement was annulled and the Qixing decided to lead their own investigation.  During  World Quest  Series  The Chasm Delvers , the Traveler and the  Chasm Exploration Team  investigate the source of the anomalies in the mines. After freeing the Wishstone and following trails left behind by the Fatui  Ninth Company 's investigations, the Traveler makes their way to the Spiritstone, where they find it being bound by Abyssal power. Releasing the Spiritstone caused a Khaenri'ahn  Ruin Serpent , Haftvad the Worm, to emerge, which was only defeated after  Yelan  dislodged the Spiritstone and crushed the Ruin Serpent underneath it. After Haftvad's destruction, the Spiritstone floated back up, albeit to a lower altitude than before.  During  Archon Quest   Interlude Chapter : Act II -  Perilous Trail , a group consisting of the Traveler,  Paimon ,  Arataki Itto ,  Kuki Shinobu ,  Yanfei , and Yelan fall into the space underneath the Spiritstone. There, they discovered that the domain it was connected to had a mysterious property which completely annihilated the power of the Abyss, but also doomed the  Millelith  soldiers and the  Yaksha   Bosacius  who had willingly sealed themselves in there to destroy the Abyssal threat during the  cataclysm .    Tsurumi Island [ ]   It is implied that the  Thunderbird  witnessed a divine nail fall onto  Tsurumi Island  during their reign, which temporarily stopped the storms on the island before causing it to be enshrouded in fog. [16]   Sumida  speculates the nail may have been the cause of a ley line disorder, which then mixed with the Thunderbird's power to produce the unique time-related properties of the island. [17]   There is no visible nail on Tsurumi Island, although there is a withered Irminsul tree on  Shirikoro Peak , similar to the withered trees in Dragonspine, Mt. Damavand and the Chasm.    Mt. Damavand/Eternal Oasis [ ]   In  Sumeru , a divine nail was responsible for its desertification. [18]  It was used to combat the forbidden knowledge accumulated by  Apep . [ citation needed ]  The nail's impact is implied to have created  Mount Damavand  and its power formed a permanent tornado in its center, which is the main cause of the sandstorms around the  Desert of Hadramaveth . This event occurred during the rule of the three God-Kings and led to  Nabu Malikata 's death and the destruction of  Ay-Khanoum . [19] [20] [21]  According to legend,  King Deshret  found the divine nail and used its power, along with the power of the  Jinn , to create the  Eternal Oasis  as a cemetery for Nabu Malikata. [22]   Although the nail is not shown in-game, there is a withered Irminsul tree in the Eternal Oasis, similar to the withered trees in other locations. Additionally, a faint blue light resembling that of the other divine nails is visible behind the sandstorm at the heart of Mount Damavand.    Night Kingdom [ ]   In  Natlan 's  Night Kingdom , the tip of a divine nail is shown briefly in  \"Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn\"  and during Act 2 of the Archon Quest when visiting the Night Kingdom. It can also be seen in-game by canceling  Nightsoul Totem  challenges, or by glitching through the underground  phlogiston  river below  Ameyalco Waters .

    "Dragon": "Dragon     Type   Species Lore       Dragons , also known in their juvenile form as  Vishaps , are enormous and powerful creatures that inhabit both land and sea of  Teyvat .  They are creatures of the  Light Realm  and were the dominant race of the old world before the arrival of the  Heavenly Principles . It defeated the  Seven Sovereigns , the dragon-lords who ruled the old world, and created a new world for humanity.

Some are quadrupedal, some are serpentine, and some either have wings or none at all. They typically have physical attributes reminiscent of their associated element; for example, the Earth Dragon  Azhdaha  has rough stone skin befitting of  Geo ,  Dvalin  has a much more sleek and svelte appearance befitting of  Anemo . [Note 1]  A dragon's size is proportional to its strength; the immensely powerful Azhdaha, at his full strength, was as large as a mountain range [2]  and his size when fought in  Beneath the Dragon-Queller  is his form after years of erosion; [3]  Dvalin is also stated to have suddenly grown in both size and power when he reemerged as Stormterror. [4]   Vishaps and elemental dragons are born from the elements. [5] [6] [Note 2]  The ancestors of all vishaps, and thus presumeably all dragons, are the  Fontemer [7] . All dragons can thus be said to descend from the  Primordial Sea . As elemental beings, they have far longer lifespans than mortals and even  gods . [6]  They typically grow more powerful with age, and several dragons are known for having enough strength to rival the likes of  Archons  and other similarly powerful beings; such dragons include Azhdaha, [6] [8]   Dvalin , [5]  and  Durin . [9]  However, other dragons like  Ursa the Drake  can be felled by powerful  Vision  or  Delusion -bearers. [10]   Dragons are not immune to  erosion  and are still subjected to the rules of the  Heavenly Principles . [6]  Vishaps and elemental dragons in particular are also extremely susceptible to the darkness of the  Void Realm . [11]     Vishaps [ ]   Main articles:  Vishaps  and  Dragonheir of the Depths   Vishaps ( Chinese :  龙蜥  lit. \"Dragon-Lizard\" ) are reptilian creatures who have existed since primeval times. They are believed to develop into dragons after long periods of time, [12]  such as how Azhdaha is from the Geovishap species. [3]  Some vishap species such as the  Geovishaps  are able to absorb elemental energy from the ley lines and some vishap species, such as the  Bathysmal Vishaps , are even capable of evolution, allowing them to inherit more and better combat-related characteristics than their predecessors. However, this evolution has severe consequences for their race — namely, the fact that they are no longer elementally \"pure\" and thus cannot have one of the Seven Sovereigns be born among them. [13]     Saurians [ ]   Main article:  Saurian Saurians are the descendants of the ancient Pyro Dragons of  Natlan  which have diverged into six lineages after being acknowledged by the  Wayob  and the  Night Kingdom :  Tepetlisaurs   ,  Yumkasaurs   ,  Koholasaurs   , Qucusaurs, Iktomisaurs  , and Tatankasaurs. Unlike in other nations, they live alongside the humans of Natlan in peace, and are considered equal members of the community.  Melusines [ ]   Main article:  Melusine Melusines are the \"daughters of  Elynas \" created during a Pneumousia explosion inside Elynas' corpse during a clash between the  Marechaussee Phantom  and the  Narzissenkreuz Ordo  over 400 years ago. They are considered to be a new form of Hydro vishap or \"dragonheir\" in multiple instances [14] [15] , taking the form of young girls with features resembling sea slugs. They may however be aligned more with the  Void  than the  Vishap Realm  due to the abyssal nature of their progenitor [16] [17] .  Elemental Dragons [ ]   Elemental dragons ( Chinese :  元素之龙 ) have not been well-documented, although several examples exist; Dvalin [5]  and the Seven Sovereigns [11]  are explicitly called elemental dragons, while Azhdaha is an elemental dragon by deduction. [3]   Elemental dragons and  ley lines  will affect each other. During the events of the  Prologue  Chapter,  Dvalin 's rampage sent  Mondstadt 's elemental flow and ley lines into disarray, which forced the  Knights of Favonius  to cut off his connection to the other three of the  Four Winds ' temples. [4] [Note 3]  Powerful Geovishaps are capable of drawing energy from ley lines; [18]  Azhdaha planned on absorbing the energy from the entire world's ley lines and using it to destroy everything after freeing himself from the Dragon-Queller, [19]  and at the start of his boss fight's second phase, he draws energy from the ley lines through his limbs. [3]  Conversely, when human mining at  the Chasm  damaged the ley lines, it brought Azhdaha physical agony. [6]   It is unknown whether non-elemental dragons exist, as all natural-born dragons named in the game have an elemental affiliation. Durin was created through alchemy and may not be subject to normal dragon physiology, while  Ursa the Drake  only appeared in the  Manga  and little detail went into its background or abilities.    History [ ]   According to legend, dragons were the dominant species of the old world and were led by the  Seven Sovereigns  and the Dragon King  Nibelung . When the  Heavenly Principles  descended, it waged war against the Seven Sovereigns and after forty years of battle, emerged victorious with the help of its four shining shades. It began recreating the world to pave the way for humanity, while those who refused to capitulate, such as the  Bathysmal Vishaps , fled into the oceans. [1]   Since then, dragons have often come into conflict with denizens of the Human Realm, including humans and  gods . Ancient gods and dragons have \"never seen eye-to-eye,\" [5]  and on the rare occasion that gods, humans, and dragons have managed to coexist, later circumstances would drive rifts between dragons and those of the Human Realm. [2] [20]   However, according to  Apep , the majority of dragons that had been reborn were now free from the hatred they once harbored against gods and humans, [21]  thus mostly ending the feud between them apart from a select few.    The Archon War [ ]   In  Liyue ,  Azhdaha 's awakening caused the earth to tremble with every movement he made.  Morax  approached him, seeking to stop the earth's shaking, and managed to befriend the dragon for some time, [2]  with the dragon even participating in the  Archon War  on Morax's behalf. However, later on, a combination of  erosion  and human mining at  the Chasm  caused Azhdaha to forget his friends and his love for humanity. Azhdaha lashed out and attacked the Chasm, destroying the settlement at  Tianqiu Valley  in the process. [22]  Morax chose his duty to protect humanity and personally went to the mines to subdue him. Even the Geo Archon's power alone was insufficient to overpower the eroding dragon; he needed the help of  Moon Carver ,  Mountain Shaper , and an unnamed adeptus to create a domain that would be able to seal Azhdaha away, and even then, Azhdaha willingly allowed himself to be sealed. [6] [8]   In  Inazuma , the god  Orobashi  fell into  Enkanomiya  and eventually became its people's god, subduing the Bathysmal Vishaps which had harassed the humans and further empowering the  Dainichi Mikoshi . [23]  It personally led research into Bathysmal Vishaps and their evolution. In the process, Orobashi and the researchers eventually came to the conclusion that vishaps naturally rejected Orobashi's power because they came from different realms, although they eventually succeeded in grafting Orobashi's coral onto vishaps. [24]  These coral fragments are necessary for the  Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri , a ritual that prevents  Watatsumi Island  from being absorbed by the Elemental Realm. [25] [26]   As a result of the Bathysmal Vishaps' \"impure\" evolutions into  Cryo  and  Electro  forms, this caused a prophecy to claim that the  Hydro Dragon  would be reborn in a human form. [24]   In  Sumeru ,  Apep , the Dendro Sovereign, was corrupted by  King Deshret . Apep allowed Deshret to build a kingdom in its lands in return for it consuming his body for his knowledge when he died, but King Deshret died with forbidden knowledge, causing great anguish to Apep as it had to muster all of its strength to survive, unable to analyze the knowledge acquired. [21]   In  Fontaine , the  Hydro Dragon  was the \"first heart\" of the  Primordial Sea  and had absolute command over it. [27]   The first Sovereign  gave  Remus  a goblet of primordial water. [28] [29]  However, the Hydro Dragon presumably perished in the battle of the Seven Sovereigns against the Heavenly Principles. Later on, the Dragon Prince  Scylla  gathered barbarians, Vishaps, and Lochknights to wage war against  Remuria . The Harmost  Boethius  sealed Scylla's power, [30]  but eventually both Remuria and the rebellion army got swept away by an inexorable storm, implying to be the  Abyss . [31]     After the Archon War [ ]   Sometime after  Barbatos  became the Anemo Archon and new sovereign god over  Mondstadt , the newborn sky dragon  Dvalin  appeared before him, enamored by his music. Barbatos sang songs of Dvalin's beauty and befriended the dragon, later naming him the Dragon of the East of the  Four Winds . [5] [32]   Around 1,000 years ago,  Ursa the Drake  lurked around Mondstadt, occasionally threatening the  City of Mondstadt . Ten years before her rebellion,  Vennessa  and her tribe, having wandered far from their homeland, were attacked by the dragon and fled to Mondstadt. Although they were taken in, they were promptly enslaved by the corrupt  Mondstadt Aristocracy . When Vennessa stood up to  Barca Lawrence  on  Venti  — who unbeknownst to them, was Barbatos' mortal disguise — the Lawrence scion retaliated by purchasing Vennessa and her entire tribe, and forcing Vennessa to win successive gladiatorial battles for their freedom. The Lawrences, however, had no plans on letting Vennessa win; in exchange for peace, they negotiated with Ursa the Drake to sacrifice Vennessa and her tribe to it. In the middle of the battle, Venti revealed his true identity and drove Ursa away. [33]   After  Egeria  had left from hibernation in the  deep sea  at an unknown specific time, the reborn Hydro Sovereign,  Neuvillette , was born. [34]  The Enkanomiya prophecy that the new Hydro Sovereign would be born in human form ended up becoming true, as Neuvillette was a human. However, he has not regained his full power and memory from his predecessor, since the Ancient Dragon's Authority was still separated from him as an  Archon 's Divine Seat.    The Cataclysm [ ]   The  Khaenri'ah  alchemist \"Gold\"  Rhinedottir  created one of her masterpieces, the artificial dragon  Durin . 500 years ago, around the time of the  cataclysm , she sent Durin to the surface world; however, it ended up unleashing havoc and destruction upon Mondstadt on its arrival. Hearing the suffering of his people, Barbatos awoke from his slumber and summoned Dvalin to aid him in ending Durin's rampage. The two eventually emerged victorious, slaying Durin over  Dragonspine ; however, Dvalin ended up ingesting Durin's poisonous blood and fell into a deep slumber in  the ruins of Old Mondstadt  to recuperate. [5] [32]   Around 500 years ago,  Focalors , the second  Hydro Archon , managed to send Neuvillette a letter to invite him to the  Court of Fontaine  as the Iudex. [35] [36]  Neuvillette agreed, hoping to find the answer to his existence and his lost memory. [37] [38]     Present Day [ ]   Four years before the events of the game, on  Diluc 's eighteenth birthday, Ursa the Drake was lured into attacking his and his father  Crepus ' caravan. [Note 4]  Their entire retinue was slain and Diluc was defeated by the dragon when Crepus intervened, using a  Delusion  to repel the dragon. However, the Delusion's power backfired on him; he died shortly afterwards, [39]  either from the Delusion itself [40]  or by Diluc killing him to spare him the agony. [41]  Sometime afterwards,  Il Dottore  visited Mondstadt and personally slew Ursa, thus indebting Mondstadt to the  Fatui . [10]   During the events of the  Prologue  Chapter, the  Abyss Order  sought to weaponize Dvalin in their plans to destroy the nations of  Teyvat  and eventually,  Celestia . [42]  However, their plot was eventually foiled by the combined efforts of Venti, the  Traveler ,  Jean , and Diluc. Freed from the poisonous blood that put him in physical agony and freed from the Abyss Order's lies, Venti and Dvalin's friendship was rekindled and Dvalin became Mondstadt's ally once more.  Azhdaha, through the artificial vessel  Jiu , attempted to break Morax's seal at the Dragon-Queller by having miners chip away at the seal from outside, while Azhdaha overpowered it from within. The plan was eventually thwarted when  Zhongli  (Morax's mortal vessel), the Traveler, and  Kun Jun  — who was unknowingly possessed by a fragment of Azhdaha's consciousness that retained his goodwill towards humanity — investigated the miners' disappearance and stumbled upon the plot. After a hard-fought battle, Azhdaha's body was resealed, while his spirit went dormant again. [6]   Nahida, who was supposed to take care of Apep, had initially forgotten about her task due to her tampering of  Irminsul  to remove the forbidden knowledge. [43]  The removal of the forbidden knowledge ended up creating a large void in Apep's body, and by the time Nahida had remembered her task, Apep was on the verge of death, of which it would unintentionally destroy Sumeru with its abundance of energy. Apep was successfully saved by Nahida and two elemental fungi that had successfully escaped Apep's body during the cataclysm, with the elemental fungi sacrificing themselves to restore the Heart of Oasis in Apep's body. Although remaining distrustful of the gods and humans, Apep elected to instead watch them to see how far they could go under the Heavenly Principles. [44]   Neuvillette recovers his authority as part of Focalors' plan to divert the  prophecy  and save the people of Fontaine during the event of  Archon Quest   Chapter IV : Act V -  Masquerade of the Guilty . He uses the power to absolve Fontainians, granting them the true properties of human due to his absolute control of Hydro and the Primordial Sea, ensuring that they are not dissolved in the sea once more when the second diluvian comes.  In  Natlan , dragons known as  Saurians  are common. These dragons have gone through long years of evolution and have since co-existed with humanity; Neuvillette speculates that he would not find himself welcome there.

The English version does not specify what two creatures it is based on.  In Liyue folklore and media, Morax is often depicted as a dragon, using a form nearly identical to his Exuvia's. [46]   Although  Haishan  is never explicitly called a dragon,  Beidou 's epithet in the Chinese version is Dragon Lord ( Chinese :  龙王 ), which is translated in the English localization as the \"Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean.\" The exact origin of this byname is unclear, but it is likely related to her slaying of the leviathan.   In the Chinese text, powerful, antagonistic dragons have been dubbed  魔龙  \"Demon/Evil/Magic Dragon\" ; this is usually translated as \"evil dragon,\" reinterpreted, or left out of the English localization entirely. Dragons who have been called by this phrase currently include:  Azhdaha, in Linlang's  Hidden in Nameless Treasures  dialogue (Chinese only, used as part of a sentence rather than a title)   Durin, in  Iris ' dialogue   Dvalin, in his epithet Stormterror ( Chinese :  风魔龙  \"Wind Demon Dragon\" )   Ursa the Drake, whose Chinese name is  魔龙乌萨  \"Demon Dragon Ursa\"   The following have been described as \"dragon-like,\" but are never directly or explicitly linked to dragons:  Baqiu, a behemoth of a sea monster that Morax fought against in ages past. [47]  In Chinese mythology, a Qiu ( Chinese :  虬 ) is a type of horned dragon; Baqiu ( Chinese :  八虬 ) was thus likely an eight-horned dragon-like monster.   Chi , another sea creature in the Liyue region. Morax defeated one that took over Mt. Qingce, [48]  while the  Skipper  defeated another one and turned its spine into  Serpent Spine . [49] [Note 7]   Orobashi  is, on one occasion, described as a \"dragon-like serpent god.\" [50]   Elynas , described as a \"great beast\" and whose remains in the Beryl Region somewhat resemble those of large draconic beasts. The children of Elynas, the  Melusines , are referred to as \"dragons\" or \"vishaps\" on numerous occasions [14] [15] , and Elynas' flesh and blood is described by  Rene  as having the same properties as the abyssal dragon Durin [16] .   Much like the  Fontemer ,  Egeria  and her resulting creations, the  Oceanids , Fontainians, and (indirectly)  Remurians  were created using only the original materials of Teyvat ( The Primordial Sea ), and Fontainians are thus considered forms of life requiring the Hydro Sovereign Neuvillette's care, equally to dragons. [51]  Egeria in particular held not just the authority of the Hydro Dragon, but also its heart. [52]   Notes [ ]     ↑   In Azhdaha's design notes and the Chinese version of  Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved , Azhdaha is called an Earth Dragon ( Chinese :  地龙 ) rather than a Geo Dragon, which would be  岩龙 , although he is still affiliated with the Geo element. The English localization similarly opts to translate  风龙  as \"Wind Dragon\" instead of \"Anemo Dragon\" in  Breeze Amidst the Forest .     ↑   Azhdaha claims that he was \"forged of elemental crystal\" ( Chinese :  元素结晶创生之物  \"born from elemental crystallization,\" ) while his design notes mention that he is of the same species as Geovishaps.     ↑   The term translated as \"elemental sphere\" ( Chinese :  元素流动 ) in  Knights of Favonius  is translated as \"elemental flow\" in the rest of the game, which is a more accurate translation.     ↑   When Vennessa faced off against Ursa 1,000 years ago, it was much larger than her and only fled after Venti directly ordered it to leave. By comparison, the Ursa faced by Diluc, Crepus, and later Dottore four years ago is much smaller. Whether Ursa weakened and shrank over time, or if the two are entirely different dragons of the same species, is left unknown.     ↑  5.0   5.1   Can also absorb  Cryo ,  Pyro ,  Hydro , and  Electro     ↑   The original Hydro Dragon likely had a presence in Fontaine, given its control over the Primordial Sea. Whether its domain was limited to modern Fontaine's borders has not been addressed.     ↑   The Chinese name for Serpent Spine is  螭骨剑  \"Chi Spine Sword.\"       References [ ]     ↑  1.0   1.1   Book:  The Byakuyakoku Collection , Vol. 2 -  Before Sun and Moon     ↑  2.0   2.1   2.2   Weapon Lore:  The Unforged     ↑  3.0   3.1   3.2   3.3   Design Notes:  The Birth of a Dragon: A Behind the Scenes Look At the Creation of Azhdaha     ↑  4.0   4.1   Archon Quest, Prologue, Act I -  The Outlander Who Caught the Wind , Part 8:  Knights of Favonius     ↑  5.0   5.1   5.2   5.3   5.4   5.5   Book:  Breeze Amidst the Forest , Vol. 1 -  Ballad Selection Excerpt     ↑  6.0   6.1   6.2   6.3   6.4   6.5   6.6   Story Quest, Zhongli, Historia Antiqua Chapter: Act II -  No Mere Stone , Part 4:  Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved     ↑   Voice-Overs,  Neuvillette   \"The Vishaps' ancestry can be traced directly back to the Fontemer, which is why they are so adept at evolution.\"     ↑  8.0   8.1   Liyue Hidden Exploration Objective, Unordered:  Hidden in Nameless Treasures     ↑   Event  The Chalk Prince and the Dragon  Quest: Act II, Part 2:  Archon's Rival     ↑  10.0   10.1   Manga, Chapter 1:  Bad Wine (Part 1)  (pg. 12)     ↑  11.0   11.1   Event  Three Realms Gateway Offering  Quest,  Aphotic Diffusal :  Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve     ↑   Character and Weapon Enhancement Material:  Fossilized Bone Shard     ↑   Archive, Living Beings, Enemies and Monsters, Mystical Beasts:  Rimebiter Bathysmal Vishap Hatchling     ↑  14.0   14.1   Neuvillette's Character Story:  Character Story 3     ↑  15.0   15.1   Sigewinne     ↑  16.0   16.1   Enigmatic Page (V)     ↑   Enemy Family,  Breacher Primus     ↑   Event  Legend of the Vagabond Sword  Enemy:  Revived Primo Geovishap     ↑   NPC Dialogue:  Jiu     ↑   Archon Quest Chapter:  Prologue     ↑  21.0   21.1   Story Quest, Nahida, Sapientia Oromasdis Chapter: Act II -  Homecoming , Part 2:  What Shape Does the Self Hold     ↑   World Quest:  Trails in Tianqiu     ↑   PlayStation Blog:  Genshin Impact version 2.4 brings grand celebrations and a mysterious new area to Teyvat     ↑  24.0   24.1   Book:  The Byakuyakoku Collection , Vol. 5 -  Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records     ↑   World Quest Act:  The Moon-Bathed Deep     ↑   World Quest:  The Still Water's Flow     ↑   Wind Glider:  Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters     ↑   Weapon Ascension Material:  Broken Goblet of the Pristine Sea     ↑   Artifact, Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy:  The Grand Jape of the Turning of Fate     ↑   Weapon:  Song of Stillness     ↑   Artifact, Golden Troupe:  Golden Night's Bustle     ↑  32.0   32.1   Archon Quest, Prologue, Act II -  For a Tomorrow Without Tears , Part 3:  That Green Fellow     ↑   Manga, Prologue:  Songs of the Wind     ↑   World Quest, Canticles of Harmony: Second Movement -  Prisoner In Shackles , Part 1:  The Last Day of Remuria Monsieur Os : Well, \"fell dragon\" was the name they gave, but it was no more than a Vishap that was a teensy bit stronger than normal.

    "Erosion": "Erosion     Type   Lore       Erosion  is a general term for the process of getting mentally  eroded , or worn down, by a combination of factors affecting someone's life, including natural memory loss as well as emotional loss or experiencing traumatic events. Eventually, erosion will cause a person to lose their sense of self. Even powerful, long-lived beings like  gods  and elemental  dragons  are susceptible to erosion.    Contents     1   Effects of Erosion   2   Preventing Erosion   3   Other Languages   4   Change History   5   References   6   Navigation       Effects of Erosion [ ]   Erosion naturally occurs over time and is both caused by and causes the loss of memories. Eventually, it will result in the loss of one's consciousness and sense of self, making them more irritable and suspect to explosive fits of rage; as a result, the more powerful a person is, the more dangerous they become under the effects of erosion.  Zhongli , the current form of the former Geo Archon  Morax , indirectly confirms the  Traveler 's suspicions that erosion was one of his motivations for stepping down from his position. [1]   Currently, the only entity known to have completely succumbed to erosion is  Azhdaha . He lost his memories of Morax,  Liyue Harbor , and his coexistence with humanity despite Morax's attempts to delay Azhdaha's erosion. Mining at  The Chasm  damaged the  ley lines , which inflicted pain on Azhdaha. Already irritable from the effects of erosion, Azhdaha flew into a rage and lashed out at the miners, forcing Morax and three of the  adepti  to seal him away underneath the  Dragon-Queller . With what little consciousness he had left, Azhdaha willingly allowed himself to be sealed away; however, over time, erosion wore away his memories of his choice, leading him to believe Morax a tyrant. [1]     Preventing Erosion [ ]   Morax shared with us some of his power, to prevent further erosion. But... it was futile. Everything returns to dust. It is the natural order, an unstoppable force. — Azhdaha  (through  Kun Jun ), about erosion [1]   Two attempts at stalling or circumventing erosion have been mentioned.  The first is Zhongli's attempt to halt Azhdaha's erosion by sharing his powers with Azhdaha, which ultimately failed. According to Azhdaha and  Zhongli , erosion is part of the \"natural order\" and is \"imposed\" by the  Heavenly Principles . [1]   The second is  Ei 's creation of  the Shogun , an autonomous puppet designed with the explicit purpose of withstanding erosion. [2]  Following the losses she sustained during the  cataclysm  and her ascension to the seat of the Electro Archon, Ei became fixated on \"eternity,\" hoping to preserve Inazuma's prosperity forever. Aware that her spirit was susceptible to erosion, she created the Shogun, who would rule  Inazuma  in her stead while she secluded herself within the  Plane of Euthymia  to stave off erosion through meditation. [3]  Because Ei believed she could potentially become an enemy of eternity herself, she deliberately made the Shogun's operational rules difficult to change even by herself, as change would not be conducive towards eternity.

A lie.\" [3]   Nahida  learned about this theory from  Dottore  in exchange of her  Dendro   Gnosis . He explained it is \"the secret hidden by  Irminsul  concerning the 'truth' of this world.\" [4]   In the description for  Staff of the Scarlet Sands ,  King Deshret  claims  Malikata  \"described the night sky adorned with  three bright moons ,\" repeating that \"the number of moons should be three\" and postulating that \"the celestial sphere was just an illusion...\" [5]     The Split-Sky Phenomenon [ ]           The fragments visible after the split-sky phenomenon closed       During the Abyssal invasion of Natlan,  Mavuika  channeled power from the six modern incarnations of the heroes who fought with her during the cataclysm along with  Ronova 's power to destroy the rift that was responsible for the invasion. The sheer strength of her strike was potent enough to break through Teyvat's skies, revealing an alleged proof of the false sky along with a  shattered moon-like planet . [2]  However, most of the people paid little heed to it, though Mavuika later disclosed to the  Traveler  that it was worth investigating, as they had not been observed in any other nation. Therefore, she guessed that the  Heavenly Principles  wished to keep the matter secret, and hoped that they would not cause her too much trouble over it. She decided she would simply tell the masses that it was an \"astronomical anomaly.\" [1]   The split-sky phenomenon closed shortly afterward, but the shattered celestial body it disclosed is now faintly visible from Natlan, just to the right of the  Great Volcano of Tollan  when viewed from  Toyac Springs . It is notable that \"stars\" can appear in front of the fragments, supporting the theory that they are behind a false sky.

    "Forbidden_Knowledge": "Forbidden Knowledge     Type   Lore       Region   Teyvat       Forbidden knowledge , also referred to as the  apocalypse , is a form of knowledge that does not belong to  Teyvat . It is a form of \"truth\" that cannot be understood and is constantly rejected by the world. Because of its alien nature, this knowledge has ill effects on objects and living creatures alike. [1]   According to  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata , forbidden knowledge originates from the very bottom of the  Abyss .

However, this knowledge proved to be massively destructive towards the world and its inhabitants, causing the heavens and earth to nearly collapse before the Heavenly Principles cast down the  divine nails  to stabilize the world. [2] [3]   Two more known surges of forbidden knowledge have occurred since Nibelung brought it to Teyvat. The first happened in the  Great Red Sand  several thousand years ago, when  King Deshret  pursued forbidden knowledge in an attempt to rebel against the Heavenly Principles. [4]  The second was during the  cataclysm  five hundred years ago; while the details are unclear, it appears that  Khaenri'ahns  also sought forbidden knowledge in order to defy the rules that the world under the Heavenly Principles were subjected to.

[1]   Though little is known about them, they are implied to be more powerful than the  Seven Archons , with Istaroth named as a \"higher power\" compared to the  late Electro Archon .

Members [ ]   Istaroth [ ]   Main article:  Istaroth   Istaroth is the Ruler of Time, [1]  also known by myriad names including the \"thousand winds\" and \"Kairos.\" She was worshiped in  Mondstadt  alongside  Barbatos , [4]  and in  Enkanomiya [1]  before the state religion of the  Sunchildren  was imposed. Time and Wind are known to be deeply connected, with variations of a similar saying arising in Mondstadt, \"seeds of stories, brought by the wind and cultivated by time.\" Both are hinted to be connected to  erosion  in the description of  Sacrificial Fragments . In the present day, Istaroth has been forgotten to have ever been a deity of Mondstadt.  When  Enkanomiya  fell into the depths of the ocean,  Istaroth  responded to the people's pleas for help. However, the Heavenly Principles and the other three Shades were unable to hear them. [1]   Istaroth was likely involved in Raiden Makoto's plan to create the  Sacred Sakura , which involved creating a stable time loop that planted the Sacred Sakura in the past while inside Makoto's  realm of consciousness , a place where \"time was moving forward and backward at the same time.\" [2]     Ronova [ ]   Main article:  Ronova   Ronova is the Ruler of Death. [5]  She helped  Natlan  establish its rules and gave guidance to  Yohualtecuhtin , the Lord of the Night, in creating the  Night Kingdom  out of an expression of love and act of reparation. However, these actions were considered to be overstepping her authority as a Shade and displeased the Heavenly Principles. [3]     Unnamed Shade [ ]   One unnamed shade, speculated to be the Ruler of Life  (unofficial name) , had the duty to create life [6]  and was responsible for helping the Heavenly Principles create animals, plants, and humans. [1]  She is described as the envoy of  Celestia . [6]  Following the deposition of the  Primordial Sea 's first heart, the  Hydro Dragon , she created  Egeria  to function as the Primordial Sea's new heart. [6]     Trivia [ ]   The Heavenly Principles and its Shades' attributes have been speculated to align with the five  Artifact  types:  life  (the unnamed Shade),  death  (Ronova),  time  (Istaroth),  void , [Note 1]  and  reason . [Note 2]   The  Unknown God  has been theorized to be one of the four Shades, specifically the Ruler of Void  (unofficial name) , based on her self-introduction as the \"sustainer of  heavenly principles \" and her resemblance to the  Herrscher of the Void  from  Honkai Impact 3rd .

The ghosts in  Wuwang Hill  and  Tsurumi Island  appear to be memory recreations made by the  Ley Lines .  The appearances of ghosts varies across  Teyvat . Most ghosts (such as the ones encountered in Wuwang Hill and  Mingyun Village ) still retain their original human forms after death with clear features such as clothing, age, and gender to tell them apart. The  Shades of Tokoyo  in  Enkanomiya , while still having a human shape, mostly lack identifiable features beyond their robes (such as hair and facial features) and resemble dark ghostly mannequins that all look identical to each other. The ghosts of Tsurumi Island appear as featureless blobs that barely resemble humans in shape, and it's unknown whether this is the result of spiritual degradation from the  Ley Line Disorder  that affected the island or is simply a cultural afterlife belief unique to the former inhabitants.  Hanachirusato  is an outlier because she is a memory recreation of  Kitsune Saiguu  made of \"filth\" by the  Sacred Sakura , complete with a non-spectral physical form, and is a different entity from the original Kitsune Saiguu.

[4]  After  Nibelung 's great war of vengeance left the Heavenly Principles gravely injured and unable to use its absolute authority to subdue the world's original order, the Heavenly Principles and \" one who came after \" created the Gnoses as part of a \"new order.\" [5]  The gods were driven to fight each other over possession of the Gnoses, with seven victors ultimately being chosen to each possess one of the elemental Gnoses. [3]   Taking on a physical appearance reminiscent of a gleaming chess piece, Gnoses typically reside within an Archon's chest. [1] [3]  They can either be forcefully removed through the powers of another god (as with the powers bestowed upon the  Eleven Fatui Harbingers  by the  Tsaritsa ), [1]  or willfully materialized and given away by the Archon themselves. [2] [6]   It is suggested that  Visions  began appearing either around the same time as the Gnoses or after The Seven were established, [5]  and  Venti  calls Visions \"primitive\" compared to the Gnoses. [1]  Like Visions, Gnoses can hold their users' ambitions and obsessions, and losing the Gnosis can take the former owner's ambitions away. [7]  Just as Visions cannot be destroyed or tampered with via mundane human methods, [8] [9]   Ei  failed in her attempts to turn her Gnosis into an energy supply device, [10]  although others have succeeded in using Gnoses to empower other devices.    Current Ownership [ ]   The  Tsaritsa  seeks to collect the Gnoses for unknown reasons. As of  Archon Quest   Chapter IV : Act V -  Masquerade of the Guilty , six of them are in  Fatui 's possession:    The  Cryo  Gnosis, possessed by the Tsaritsa.   The  Anemo  Gnosis, obtained by  La Signora  forcibly taking it from  Barbatos . [1]   The  Geo  Gnosis, obtained by La Signora after fulfilling the Tsaritsa's end of the contract with  Rex Lapis . [6]   The  Electro  Gnosis, obtained by  Il Dottore  after agreeing to  Lesser Lord Kusanali 's ultimatum that he erase his segments in exchange, lest she destroy the Gnosis and potentially awaken the Heavenly Principles. [3]   Lesser Lord Kusanali obtained the Gnosis after defeating  Scaramouche , [3]  with whom  Yae Miko  exchanged the Gnosis for the  Traveler 's safety, [2]  which was originally entrusted to her by  Ei  after she no longer had any use for it. [10]   The  Dendro  Gnosis, obtained by Il Dottore in exchange for giving Lesser Lord Kusanali information about the rumored intel that  \"the skies of Teyvat are fake.\" [3]   The  Hydro  Gnosis, obtained by  Arlecchino  as  Neuvillette 's \"diplomatic gift\" for her and  Tartaglia 's assistance against  the prophecy . [4]   Neuvillette obtained the Gnosis after  Focalors  executed herself via  the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale . [4]   The  Pyro  Gnosis is currently possessed by  Haborym . [11]   Abilities [ ]   Little is known about the Gnoses' purpose or abilities. So far, they are said to:    Allow Archons to resonate with Celestia directly [1]   Grant Archons the \"divine ability\" to defend their nation [12]   Allow the user to summon a mass of elemental power at their owner's disposal [13]   Unlike humans, Archons have innate elemental abilities and do not rely on the Gnoses to wield the elements, proven by the way Venti,  Zhongli , Ei, and  Nahida  use their elemental abilities in battle during their respective  Story Quests , after having already parted with their Gnoses. That being said, Gnoses seem to greatly enhance an Archon's abilities; Zhongli states that the \"power of the Geo Archon\" is required to create  Mora  and indicates that the  Golden House  would have to temporarily close since he can no longer do this. [6]  He also suggests that he lost a significant portion of his power after relinquishing the Gnosis, [14]  and  Azhdaha  could sense that Zhongli was no longer the Geo Archon. [15]   A god can gather their own element's power using another element's Gnosis, as seen when Nahida uses the Electro Gnosis to summon Dendro power and unlock  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata 's  realm of consciousness . However, it remains to be seen whether a god can use a Gnosis to control an entirely different element, and Il Dottore's dialogue with Nahida suggests that it is not possible. [3]   After being made into a god, Scaramouche uses the Electro Gnosis to control the weather at  Pardis Dhyai , striking many Fatui personnel and  Tighnari  with lightning. [16]  It is unknown if he had any elemental abilities or was capable of utilizing the Gnosis before his apotheosis.    As a Power Source [ ]   While Ei failed to either create a vessel capable of housing her Gnosis and modify her Gnosis into a power supply device, others have used Gnoses to empower other devices. The currently known devices are:    The  Akasha System  in  Sumeru , created by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata to combat  forbidden knowledge  during the  cataclysm  by linking the minds of those who wear Akasha Terminals. It requires the energy of the Dendro Gnosis to work, and has become defunct now that the Gnosis is in Fatui possession.   Shouki no Kami , a mechanical shell used to turn Scaramouche into an artificial god, developed by  Sumeru Akademiya 's sages in collaboration with Il Dottore and the Fatui. Following Scaramouche's defeat at the hands of Lesser Lord Kusanali and the  Traveler , it is now defunct. [3]   The Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale in  Fontaine  contained the Hydro Gnosis after Focalors merged with it in order to generate and store enough Indemnitium to execute Focalors and destroy the Hydro Archon's throne. With Focalors' execution, the Oratrice has ceased to function. [17]   Trivia [ ]   In a standard Western chess game, there are only six distinct pieces: pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, and king, which would be one short for a complete set of all The Seven's Gnoses. However, each side starts with a total of seven  major  (2 rook and 1 queen) and  minor  (2 knight and 2 bishop) pieces. Upon reaching the other side of the chessboard, a pawn can also promote these pieces.  The models of the Anemo Gnosis and Geo Gnosis resemble the queen and rook, respectively. Queens and rooks are considered major pieces, or pieces that can checkmate the opponent with only their own king for support.  In  A Winter Night's Lazzo , the Anemo Gnosis is likely used as a king instead, as the board would then match a position from  a real chess game  between  Deep Blue  and  Garry Kasparov  and if the Anemo Gnosis were used as a queen in that game instead, the resulting position would be unusual. [18]  The Geo Gnosis appears to be used as a rook in the same game.   Unlike the Anemo and Geo Gnoses, the Electro Gnosis does not strongly resemble a single chess piece. The bishop and the pawn are often suggested as the models for the Electro Gnosis. A bishop is a minor piece that may be used to checkmate but requires other pieces besides the king.   The Pyro Gnosis also does not strongly resemble a chess piece, and is decorated with motifs found throughout and relating to Natlan.   The Dendro and Hydro Gnoses have not been shown.   It is currently uncertain how much the mortal people of Teyvat know about Gnoses. Venti states that his Gnosis \"isn't something [he is] meant to discuss with ordinary people,\" while many of the rank-and-file members of the Fatui do not seem to know much about the Harbinger's operations on the Tsaritsa's behalf.  Yae Miko is aware of the power of a Gnosis and its connection to Celestia, and was responsible for guarding the Electro Archon's Gnosis. Whether this is information known to the  kitsune youkai  or simply because Raiden Ei briefed her on its function beforehand remains to be determined.   Beidou  seems to have at least a basic understanding that the Gnoses belong to the Archons when the Traveler mentions their thefts during her  Hangout Event ,  When the Crux Shines Bright . [19]  How much she knows about their power and nature beyond this is currently unknown.   Though not explicitly mentioned, the  sages  involved in the god creation plan likely knew about the Electro Gnosis due to its importance to their plan.   Lyney  knew of Arlecchino's plan to use the Hydro Gnosis to break the Fontaine  prophecy  before handing it over to the Tsaritsa. [20]   Mavuika disclosed that the Harbingers were after the Gnoses to  Kinich  and  Iansan , [21]  who are among the small group of people she has been working with to save Natlan. [22]   Etymology [ ]   In  Gnosticism ,  gnosis  is a term used for wisdom, knowledge, or insight into divine nature. Through Gnosis, one can transcend the material realms controlled by the seven archons and enter the supercelestial realm of  Ogdoad .   The Chinese term for Gnosis,  神之心   Shén zhī Xīn , \"Heart of God,\"  is similar to the term for Visions ( Chinese :  神之眼   Shén zhī Yǎn , \"Eye of God\" ). Both of them are called  魔力器官  \"magical organs,\"  which was translated as \"magical foci\" in English.  During  Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo , after  Capitano  inquires about Scaramouche and the Electro Gnosis, Il Dottore replies that \"Divine Knowledge cannot be rationally comprehended.\" The Chinese equivalent for \"Divine Knowledge\" is  神之灵知   Shén zhī Língzhī , where  灵知   Língzhī  is the Chinese term for the Gnostic concept of  gnosis .

    "God": "God     Type   Lore Species       Gods  ( Chinese :  神   Shén ) are beings from the  Human Realm  with great control over elemental energy and whose lifespans are much longer than that of mortals. Most of Teyvat's gods are beholden to  Celestia , although several gods have displayed wariness or even resentment towards the heavenly citadel.  Before the  Archon War , many gods roamed the continent of  Teyvat . For reasons unknown, seven divine seats opened up in Celestia, [1] [2]  causing the continent to descend into a protracted series of conflicts that ended 2000 years ago. Over the course of the war, most gods were slain or sealed until only seven victors remained; each victor became their respective element's Archon and ruler of one of the seven nations, [Note 1]  using their powers to transform its terrain and governing the land according to their ideals.    Contents     1   Overview   2   Story     2.1   Ancient History   2.2   Archon War   2.3   Present Day       3   List of Gods     3.1   The Seven Archons   3.2   Other Gods       4   Trivia     4.1   Etymology       5   Notes   6   Other Languages   7   References   8   Navigation       Overview [ ]   Very little is currently known about the origins of gods. As evidenced by  Boreas  and  Barbatos , gods can be elevated from a lower existence and given powers from another god. [3] [4]   Morax ,  Raiden Makoto , and  Raiden Ei 's origins have been left a mystery, and have presently been referred to as gods since the start of their recorded histories.  In the past, gods were expected to have a love for humanity, and use their powers as gods to guide and protect humanity; Boreas, who held a low opinion of human society, was viewed as an oddity. [5] [6]  However, after The Seven were established and its original members passed on, the newer archons no longer upheld the duty of guiding humanity. [7]   Gods cannot be completely destroyed — even if a god's physical form is destroyed, their consciousness is worn away, and they are considered \"dead,\" their emotions and power remain. [8]   Havria 's relics kept their special properties thousands of years after her death and were ultimately thrown into the ocean by  Zhongli  so that humanity would not seek the power of a long-dead deity. Gods who place their power into the land, such as Boreas and  Marchosius , may be considered \"dead\" but can continue manifesting in the world afterwards, [9]  although how this works is currently unclear. [Note 2]   Upon death, a god's power flows out of their body and into the surrounding environment. The consequences of a god's death vary greatly, so what determines the result is currently unclear. Boreas was able to control the flow of power and use it to the benefit of the land when he voluntarily chose death. [10]  The power released upon Havria's death salinized her adherents and  Sal Terrae  was sealed off afterwards, [11]  but the region as a whole has shown no ill effects following her death. Meanwhile, a god's hatred will have negative effects on the surrounding environment and the people who reside there; for example, the  Tatarigami  on  Yashiori Island  afflicted inhabitants of the island with mysterious diseases and drove others to insanity.  Wildlife  that comes across the remains of a god and consumes it enough will mutate and transform into a  Consecrated Beast . On the other hand,  Remus 's death had no apparent negative effects on the  Sea of Bygone Eras ; instead, his will protected the ruins of Capitolium, preserving them remarkably well over 2,000 years. [12] [Note 3]   The Seven have come up with various ways of counteracting such effects, such as the  Yakshas  in Liyue who fight against the power of ancient gods, [13]  and the wards around Inazuma used to suppress the likes of Tatarigami and  Kanna Kapatcir 's power.    Story [ ]   Ancient History [ ]   Based on current knowledge, most if not all gods came into being after the establishment of the  Human Realm  and hold the Human Realm's power, making them incompatible with the  Light Realm  and  Void Realm 's powers under normal circumstances. [14]  Elemental  dragons  hold power equal to a god's. [15]     Archon War [ ]   See also:  Archon War   The Archon War was a prolonged conflict between gods for supremacy that began several thousand years ago and ended two thousand years ago. [1]  The war allegedly began over the seven divine thrones which opened up in Celestia, [2]  which may coincide with the creation of the  Gnoses  following the \"great war of vengeance\" which greatly weakened the  Heavenly Principles . [16]   Instead of warring,  Sumeru 's gods,  King Deshret ,  Nabu Malikata , and  Rukkhadevata  forged an alliance in the ancient city of  Ay-Khanoum . [17]  However, King Deshret still engaged in warfare against other gods in Sumeru beyond the alliance, such as  Remus [18] . Following Nabu Malikata's corruption by the  Abyss [19] , the city was destroyed by a Celestial  divine nail [20] , and Rukkhadevata left Deshret's lands, never to return. [21]   The  Guili Assembly , established by  Guizhong  and Rex Lapis in  Guili Plains  in the distant past, was one civilization destroyed during the chaos of the Archon War. Shortly after the fall of the Guili Assembly 3,700 years ago, Rex Lapis and the  adepti  gathered the survivors and took them south of Mt. Tianheng, where Liyue Harbor was established. [22]  Some time afterwards,  Havria  was murdered by her own people for being weak, and the survivors of  Sal Terrae  were scattered across Liyue. Rex Lapis subdued countless other gods and monsters, including  Osial ,  Chi , and  Orobashi , the latter whom survived and fled to Inazuma. [Note 4]   2600 years ago, in the midst of the Archon War,  Boreas  warred against the God of Storms,  Decarabian . In their bitter stalemate, Barbatos challenged Decarabian for the freedom of Decarabian's people and emerged victorious. After Decarabian's death, Barbatos became the new Anemo Archon, [23]  while Boreas decided himself unfit for the position and chose to pass on instead, using his winds to nurture the new Mondstadt that Barbatos created. [6]   In  Inazuma , the twin gods  Raiden Makoto  and  Raiden Ei  emerged victorious, with Makoto assuming the position of Electro Archon and her sister sharing many of her duties while acting as her kagemusha. The only rival god known to have been slain during this period was the god of  Watatsumi Island ,  Orobashi , though the Thunderbird of  Tsurumi Island ,  Kanna Kapatcir , was revered as a god by her people. Notably, the duty of slaying such foes during the Archon War fell upon Raiden Ei, rather than the Electro Archon.  In  Fontaine ,  Remus  was the sole god residing in Fontaine's surface during the Archon War, due to  Egeria 's imprisonment  beneath the waves  at the behest of the Heavenly Principles. [24]  The war in Fontaine instead took the form of  Remuria 's expansion and subjugation of various tribes, and a resistance movement led by the mortal,  Erinnyes  of Aremorica, who spread the faith of Egeria. Following the death of Remus at the hands of  Phobos , and the drowning of Remuria, Egeria was freed from her prison and granted rulership over Fontaine as its Archon [25] .  No gods are known to have lived on  Natlan 's surface throughout its history, and the Archon War period instead saw repeated conflicts between the  dragons  and humans of Natlan. The first  Pyro Archon  was a human named  Xbalanque  who defeated the still-reigning Sovereign  Xiuhcoatl , and was thus granted authority over the divine throne by the Ruler of Death,  Ronova [26] , as planned by the dragon Sage,  Waxaklahun Ubah Kan [27] . However, the god  Yohualtecuhtin  of the  Night Kingdom  had numerous relations with humans in ancient history, first helping create the  Wayob  for the tribes, [28]  and later helping create the \"Rules\" of Natlan such as the  Ode of Resurrection  with the help of Xbalanque and Ronova.   Around 2000 years ago, the Archon War drew to a close as the seventh and final victor claimed their seat. These victors were thereafter known as the  Seven Archons , and came to possess one of the  Gnoses  as well as a portion of the elemental Authority for their element. Gods who refused to live under their rule fled to islands within the Dark Sea, regions beyond the control of The Seven, where they became evil gods. [29]   Of the seven victors of the Archon War, only two remain by the start of the game's story: Barbatos and Rex Lapis. [30] [31]  While Raiden Ei was present during the Archon War, she did not assume the position of Electro Archon until her twin sister Makoto perished during the  cataclysm  500 years ago. Most of  The Seven 's current members replaced the original founders of Teyvat's seven nations.    Present Day [ ]   Among The Seven, each Archon is associated with and worshipped by one of Teyvat's seven nations. Most of a nation's elemental environment is based on its Archon's element, although areas affected by  divine nails , such as  Dragonspine , the  Great Red Sand , the  Night Kingdom , and  Tsurumi Island  tend to be noticeably different from their surroundings.  An Archon's power is directly tied to their level of control over their nation. As a result,  Venti  — who travels as a bard and refuses to directly control the people of Mondstadt — is, by his own admission, extremely weak by Archon standards. [32]  However, this is later indirectly challenged by  Nahida , who states that an Archon's power is tied to how much faith their people have in them. When a person's powerful wish reaches the heavens, Archons are obligated to give that person a Vision, which is a shard of the elemental Authorities [16]  and allows the recipient to manipulate elemental energy. Vision wielders are known as \"allogenes\" and are also privileged with the chance of rising to godhood. [33]  In the year that the  Vision Hunt Decree  was in effect in Inazuma, no new Electro Visions appeared throughout Teyvat, leading scholars to conclude that the Archons' wills play a role in Vision distribution. [34]  However, Ei is surprised to hear of this phenomenon herself and refutes the scholars' conclusion.

Erased  is only used for those who are  removed from Irminsul .     ↑   Despite being over 6,000 years old, Morax was only considered the Geo Archon after claiming one of the seats among The Seven. When exactly that occurred is unknown, although  Character Story 5  indicates he was not the last to ascend.     ↑  3.0   3.1   Although Baal is used to collectively refer to both Makoto and Ei,  Wishes  indicates that the name Baal belongs to Makoto and did not belong to Ei. As such, where applicable, Baal is considered to only be Makoto's name.     ↑   Although Makoto and Ei won the Archon War together, Ei is not considered one of the original Seven. In addition, according to  Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi , after the two won the Archon War, Ei sacrificed her body so Makoto could ascend and become the Electro Archon. Afterwards, Makoto recalled her spirit and recreated her body.     ↑   Lesser Lord Kusanali is now believed to have always been the Dendro Archon as a consequence of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's existence being  removed  from Irminsul.     ↑   The Hydro Archon's Divine Throne was destroyed along with Focalors during  Chapter IV . As a result, there will be no further Hydro Archons.     ↑   Furina  is not considered an Archon, as she did not carry any of the divinity of Focalors, possessing neither gnosis nor Divine Throne, and was fully human. This is further indicated by the conversation between Focalors and Furina shown in  The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur , in which Focalors tasks Furina with pretending to be a god without being or attempting to become one. Despite the urgency and great importance of Furina's task, Focalors did not provide Furina with anything that would help make Furina's false identity more convincing, which suggests that Focalors could not provide for Furina, and Furina did not possess, any true information or power that would allow Furina to lay an even partially truthful claim to the role of Hydro Archon.     ↑   After separating out her divinity and memories, Focalors named the human she left behind \"Furina.\" It is not known where this name comes from, but Focalors saw Furina as essentially a human version of Focalors as well as exactly the kind of human Focalors wished to be.     ↑   In  Masquerade of the Guilty , Focalors states that Egeria's justice was \"existence,\" and that Focalors's justice was the \"continuation\" of that existence. Both gods are Gods of Justice.     ↑   The Archon of Natlan is not a god, but is instead a mortal granted the authority of the divine throne by the intervention of the Ruler of Death,  Ronova , following the defeat of the Pyro Sovereign  Xiuhcoatl  at the hands of Xbalanque. According to Mavuika, a mortal who ascends to the divine throne has their \"inner flame\" awakened upon doing so, and receives power and knowledge equivalent to a god.     ↑   Mavuika was ascended during the  Cataclysm  but placed her life in the Sacred Flame to be resurrected 500 years ago to the present day. She mentions that a human life depends on burning Sacred Flame, meaning she lives as long as the Sacred Flame keeps burning.     ↑  12.0   12.1   Venti refers to the Pyro Archon as the \"Lady of Fire\" when meeting  Vennessa  1,000 years ago.     ↑  13.0   13.1   As the  Pyro Archon  position is inherited by mortals through winning the pilgrimage, they remain subject to mortality. It can safely be assumed that all Pyro Archons lived normal human lifespans and are currently deceased.     ↑   In  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail , Dainsleif suggests the Tsaritsa's ideal was originally Love. However, he refers to it in past tense, while Zhongli avoids speaking about it during  Downtown , leaving it unconfirmed.     ↑   The Tsaritsa was likely the Cryo Archon 500 years ago based on Venti's description of her in  Ending Note .       Other Gods [ ]   This list contains gods that have been mentioned in the game's lore, persons that have ascended to  Celestia , and gods that are currently not known to have been archons.

This is not absolute however, such as with the Goddess of Flowers.   Each gemstone used for  ascension  has the words and blessings from The Seven for the reader.   Gods can take whatever form they please; Morax has taken the form of a young man, a woman, and an elderly man, [82]  with  Zhongli  as his most recent vessel. Venti's vessel is based on the  Nameless Bard 's.  Vessels constructed through an archon's power have different compositions from regular human bodies; for example, Venti cannot be healed normally (in story, not in gameplay), while Zhongli indicates that he cannot get sick. That said, Venti is somehow allergic to cats. These human vessels are nonetheless not untouchable, as Venti is visibly winded and knocked unconscious from La Signora's attack.   Due to stylistic choices made by original Chinese text and the English localization, some of the terminology pertaining to gods has been the subject of debate.  In Chinese, gods before the rise of The Seven are often distinguished by including  魔神  \"Demon God\"  in their titles, but the English localization does not keep this term and usually translates it as \"God\" or omits it entirely. For example,  Decarabian 's title of  烈风的魔神  \"Demon God of Gales\"  was localized as \"God of Storms,\" while  Guizhong 's  尘王魔神  \"Dust Lord Demon God\"  was localized as \"Lord of Dust\" and Osial's  漩涡之魔神  \"Demon God of Vortexes\"  was localized as \"Overlord of the Vortex.\"   Conversely, the term \"Archon\" is used in the English localization to denote The Seven's members, based on the game's Gnostic inspiration. However, there is no equivalent term in their Chinese titles, which led to early localization issues where many instances of  神   shén , \"god\"  were indiscriminately translated as \"archon\" without taking context into account. In Version 1.3, the English localization adjusted most instances of \"archon\" to primarily refer to The Seven, but some instances have not been changed.  The Chinese name for  Archon Quests  is  魔神任务  \"Demon God Quests,\"  indicating that the Traveler's journey will involve the gods of old and not just The Seven.   The original Chinese text distinguishes some of  Morax 's accomplishments before becoming one of The Seven with the title  岩之魔神  \"Demon God of Geo,\"  as seen in  Heart of Glaze  and Zhongli's Character Story,  That Which Rises From the Sea . In both instances, the English localization opted to translate the title as \"Geo Archon\" anyways. While  Heart of Glaze  made no attempt to distinguish the phrase from typical occurrences of \"Geo Archon\" (which would normally be either  岩神  or  岩之神 ),  That Which Rises From the Sea  added the phrase \"long before he took that title\" to clarify that the story occurred before Morax became one of The Seven.   Etymology [ ]   The term \" archon \" is a Greek word that refers to \"A person who claims the right to rule, or to exercise power or sovereign authority over other human beings.\" Genshin Impact uses its  Gnostic  usage, [83]  in which the  archons  are seven supernatural beings subservient to the  demiurge , the creator of the material universe who is beneath the  Monad , the true God. Each archon presides over one of the  seven planets . By reaching  gnosis , an understanding of divine knowledge, one can transcend the confines of the mortal world and escape the dominion of the archons.  In Manichaeism, a religion derived from Gnosticism, there are five archons who together make up the Prince of Darkness. Here, the Archons are seen as an undeniably evil force.   The Chinese term for gods that predate The Seven,  魔神  \"demon god,\"  stems from the standard Chinese translation for the  demons in the Ars Goetia  — from which a deity's name is derived — is  所罗门七十二柱 魔神  \" Solomon's 72 Demon Gods .\"   Barbatos ,  Morax ,  Baal ,  Buer ,  Haborym ,  Paimon , and  Naberius  are directly lifted from the Ars Goetia.  Haborym is an alternate name for Aim.   Beelzebul is an alternate spelling of  Beelzebub , who is associated with Baal but is not from the Ars Goetia.   Focalors is derived from  Focalor .   Istaroth is derived from  Astaroth .   Ronova is derived from  Ronove ,   Decarabian is derived from  Decarabia .   Andrius may be derived from  Andras , or  Andrealphus  based on his Chinese name. (See  Boreas' Etymology section  for details.)   Havria is a feminized form of Havres, a corruption/misinterpretation of  Flauros .   Osial appears to be a portmanteau of  Ose  and either  Belial  or  Furfur , the latter based on its Chinese name. (See  Osial's Etymology section  for details.)   Marchosius is derived from  Marchosias .   Orobashi is derived from  Orobas .   Amun is derived from  Amon/Aamon  and the Egyptian deity  Amun .   Haagentus, the other name of Guizhong, is derived from  Haagenti .   The Chinese and Japanese term for \"allogenes\" is \"primordial god\" ( Chinese :  原神   Yuánshén ;  Japanese :  原神   Genshin ), the same word used in the game's title.  In Gnosticism, \" Allogenes ,\" also known as the \"Stranger,\" is a Gnostic figure who is half-human, half-divine, and has the power to communicate with other realms. In some writings about Allogenes, he is said to have become fully divine.   Notes [ ]     ↑   It is currently unclear whether the seven nations' territories were already determined before the start of the Archon War or not.     ↑   Boreas is explicitly stated to have died but can manifest himself at Wolvendom to answer a challenge and is fully conscious with his memories intact. Marchosius was only described as having entered a deep slumber, but he manifested at the shrine while Xiangling was asleep with the suggestion that he was not present when she entered the shrine. As a result of placing his power into the land, Marchosius also lost most of his mental faculties and is no longer capable of speech, unlike Boreas.     ↑   While Remus sacrificed his life to unleash the power of the  Symphony , it was the Symphony's power that caused the tsunami that sank Remuria, not his death.     ↑   Orobashi narrates in  Oathsworn Eye 's description that it was defeated by the \"Golden God\" ( Chinese :  贵金之神 ). The Chinese term was later used in  Neuvillette 's  \"About the Geo Archon\"  Voice-Over, although it was localized into English as \"Deus Auri.\"     ↑   The Chinese version of  Scattered Piece of Decarabian's Dream 's description refers to Decarabian as a  风神  \"Wind God,\"  which is a term typically translated as \"Anemo Archon\" in the English translation. As a result, the English version calls Decarabian an Anemo Archon even though he was not one of The Seven Archons; Barbatos, who ascended to godhood after Decarabian's fall, is the first and only Anemo Archon among The Seven.     ↑   Although Nahida states during  The Kabukimono's Finale  that Scaramouche \"tried to achieve godhood\" but \"was unsuccessful\" based on the Traveler's retelling of Scaramouche's story,  Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies  is filled with numerous indicators, including statements from Nahida herself, that Scaramouche did become a god in some form. As such, Scaramouche's godhood as shown in  Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies  takes precedence over Nahida's single contradictory line in  The Kabukimono's Finale .     ↑   The Chinese name of the Lord of the Night is  夜神  \"Night God.\"     ↑  8.0   8.1   Whether ascension to Celestia automatically equates to the attainment of godhood is still inconclusive. In  Ending Note , Venti states \"In truth, every wielder of a Vision is one who can attain godhood and ascend to Celestia.\" Of the people known to have ascended, there is still no evidence of them bearing Visions, and it is still ambiguous whether people without Visions can ascend Celestia, attain godhood, both, or neither.     ↑   Was worshipped as a deity, actual godhood is uncertain.     ↑   Kapatcir was given this name by  Ruu , who forged a close friendship with this deity.     ↑    Naberius is suspected to be a god, and possibly even a former archon, based on the fact that this item's name is similar to the Chinese name for Gnoses, 神之心 \"Heart of God.\"       Other Languages [ ]     Language Official Name Literal Meaning English God / Archon [• 1] — Chinese (Simplified) 魔神  /  神 Móshén / Shén Demon God / God Chinese (Traditional) 魔神  /  神 Móshén / Shén Japanese 魔神  /  神 Majin [84]  / Kami [85] Demon God / God [• 2] Korean 마신 마신 魔神  /  신 신 神 Masin / Sin Demon God / God Spanish (‍ Dios Dios Masculine term / Diosa Diosa Feminine term ‍)  / Arconte God / Archon French Dieu / Archon God / Archon Russian Бог  /  Архонт Bog / Arkhont God / Archon Thai เทพปีศาจ  /  เทพ Thep Pisat / Thep Demon God / God Vietnamese Ma Thần Ma Thần 魔神  /  Thần Thần 神 Demon God / God German Gott / Archon God / Archon Indonesian Dewa / Archon God / Archon Portuguese Deus / Arconte God / Archon Italian (‍ Dio Dio Masculine term / Dea Dea Feminine term ‍)  / Archon (‍ God God Masculine term / Goddess Goddess Feminine term ‍)  / Archon   ↑   English:  Distinction between \"God\" and \"Archon\" is inconsistent within and across languages.

The intrigue surrounding, and plots against, the Heavenly Principles are the driving force behind the conflicts of the game, as both the  Abyss Order  and the  Fatui  seek to overthrow it and end its rule over Teyvat. [Note 2]   According to  Before Sun and Moon , the identity of the Heavenly Principles, which it refers to as the Primordial One, may be Phanes.  The Heavenly Principles has been silent since the  cataclysm  500 years ago.

[2]  It took over the world from the  Seven Sovereigns , the seven ancient dragons who were the strongest of their element, and ultimately emerged victorious over them. To combat the effects of  forbidden knowledge , which was brought to this world by the Dragon King  Nibelung , it sent down several  divine nails , which stabilized the world but wreaked havoc on nature and those living on the earth. [7] [3]   The Heavenly Principles is presumably the creator of Teyvat's \"laws,\" which are now embodied by the  Gnoses , [2]  seven chess pieces originally given to the  Seven Archons  which also allow them to directly resonate with Celestia. [8]  The first of the Seven Archons (typically known simply as \"The Seven\") emerged during the  Archon War , a chaotic and destructive period of wars across Teyvat which led to the deaths or disappearances of most  gods . The Seven are subordinate to the Heavenly Principles and are subject to the rules and constraints placed on them. One such restriction is talking about the \"other side\" to how  Visions  are distributed (with the first side being a person's desire). [9]    The \"laws\" are also notably mentioned in a  Loading Screen tip  (\"Teyvat has its own 'laws'\") and in the book  Scroll of Streaming Song , where it is the answer to the second riddle: \"You speak of the universal law created in heaven, the divine laws established in the beginning.\" \"No one has seen the eternal law, yet it governs all.\" \"One may only bow down and worship Vaana of the heavenly spirits — no arrogation, deception, or trickery is permitted.\" \"If one dares to imitate the forbidden arts, only calamity awaits at the edge of divine knowledge.\"   The Heavenly Principles is capable of delivering effectively irreversible curses that fundamentally change people. [10]   Hilichurls  are actually transfigured humans, afflicted with the \"curse of wilderness\" which robs them of their forms and intellect; this was the curse given to non-pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns during the cataclysm, and as hilichurls have existed since before the cataclysm, [11]  it was presumably inflicted on humans predating the cataclysm, though there is not enough information to figure out for what reasons. [Note 3]  Pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were instead given a curse of immortality. A similar curse was inflicted on the Seelie as punishment after the war against the Sovereigns, reducing them to their current miniscule forms, although some — such as  Nabu Malikata  and the Seelie in  A Drunkard's Tale  — were able to escape the worst parts of the curse. [3] [12]     Appearance [ ]   The Heavenly Principles has been described as being androgynous, and possessing both wings and a crown. [13]     Story [ ]   Ancient History [ ]   In the time period known as \"When the Doves Held Branches,\" the emergence of the \"eternal throne of the heavens\" caused the world to be remade, separating its \"microcosm\" from the universe. The Heavenly Principles appeared to battle against the Seven Sovereigns and, to that end, created  Four Shades  of itself. One of the Shades was  Istaroth , who held dominion over time and wind. Another Shade was tasked with the creation of life and used the  Primordial Sea  to create  Egeria  to fulfill the responsibilities of the former  Hydro Dragon . [14]   After 40 years, the Heavenly Principles emerged victorious over the Seven Sovereigns and set about creating the heavens and earth to prepare for the advent of humanity. Humans were finally created 400 years after the Heavenly Principles's appearance, and they made a covenant with the Heavenly Principles. [13]  After the war, the Heavenly Principles had many of their functions ruined and could not suppress the original order of Teyvat. [15]   The Heavenly Principles had a sacred plan for humanity; the scribe of Istaroth calls the year after humanity made a covenant with the Heavenly Principles the \"Year of the Ark's Opening.\" It was followed by the \"Year of Jubilee,\" during which the world would provide its bounties for humanity. The only taboo was to succumb to temptation. [13]   An unknown amount of time after the creation of humanity, the  Second Who Came  — the second throne of the heavens — came from \"beyond the firmament,\" [3]  bringing destruction and plagues, and the resulting war destroyed both heaven and earth. [7]  Believing only another power from outside this world would be able to defeat it, the Dragon King  Nibelung  came across forbidden knowledge and used it to fight the Heavenly Principles. Afraid of the \"rising tide of delusion and breakthroughs\" brought by the invaders, the Heavenly Principles used the divine nails to prevent the world's collapse, but this also wreaked havoc on the mortal world. [3]  The heavens and earth were torn apart, and during this period of strife,  Enkanomiya  dropped into the watery abyss. Despite the people's laments, the Heavenly Principles and three of its Shades did not respond; only Istaroth did not forsake them. [13]  Despite the war, the Heavenly Principles and the one who came after created the  Gnoses  to continue subduing and controlling the resentments of the world. [15]   Two years after the creation of the  Dainichi Mikoshi , people from Enkanomiya attempted to find a way back to the surface. However, they discovered that heaven's \"powers of prohibition\" prevented them from returning. The scribe of Istaroth believed this ban was laid down by the Heavenly Principles and that it had prevailed over the Second Who Came, [13]  while  Eboshi  attributes it to the \"heavenly order\" but does not indicate who is behind the heavenly order. By the time of the  Archon War , these powers of prohibition had weakened, allowing  Orobashi  to fall into Enkanomiya and conversely, bring the people of Enkanomiya back to the surface. [16]   The Seelie, despite having fought against the invaders from beyond the firmament, were punished with exile from heaven and stripped of their beautiful forms and their wisdom. [3]  This punishment may relate to a legend about a Seelie ancestor's union with an \"outlander,\" only for a sudden disaster to strike thirty days later, which caused the world's collapse and forced them to flee from an unidentified force. They were caught and punished with eternal separation and the erasure of their memories. According to the legend, the Seelie's and the  Moon Sisters ' grief at this outcome caused them to wither away, and fragments of themselves became the modern Seelie. [17]   According to other legends,  Morax  — who is over 6,000 years old [18]  — was young when the Moon Sisters were slain in a certain calamity. [19]  It is not clear whether this calamity was the same as the Heavenly Principles' conflict against the Seven Sovereigns, but this gives a rough estimate for how long ago these events may have occurred.    Archon War [ ]   An exchange between  Scaramouche  and  Nahida  suggests that the Heavenly Principles instigated the Archon War, in which the gods fought to claim one of the seven divine thrones and obtain a Gnosis, an item which symbolizes the Heavenly Principles' control over Teyvat and all the laws. Scaramouche remarks on the Archon War by saying, \"Strife is engraved upon every god and every Gnosis brought forth into this world,\" to which Lesser Lord Kusanali responds that \"All those losses were meaningless, driven by the demands of the 'laws.'\" [6]   Around 2,000 years ago and before the Archon War ended, the Heavenly Principles was directly involved with the serpent god  Orobashi  and  Watatsumi Island . After failing to defeat two different gods in the Archon War, Orobashi was fleeing to the  Dark Sea  when it fell into a rift and discovered the people of  Enkanomiya [20]  — a surviving remnant of the Heavenly Principles's ancient unified civilization, spared from destruction when it sank underwater during the struggle against the  Second Who Came . Although the people of Enkanomiya searched for a way to return to the surface in the past, their attempts ended in failure due to a ban placed on their ancestors which prevented them from finding a way home. This ban is attributed to the Primordial One by the author of  Before Sun and Moon , [21]  and generically to the \"heavenly order\" by  Eboshi . The rift Orobashi fell through has been attributed to the heavens' weakening power of prohibition. [22]  It agreed to become the god of the Enkanomiya people, but this led Orobashi to come into contact with  Before Sun and Moon , a book which told a history of the world which the Heavenly Principles did not want known. The Heavenly Principles forced Orobashi to sacrifice itself in exchange for allowing the people of Enkanomiya to return to the surface, with the truth behind its sacrifice unknown to all besides a select few close aides. [22]   Before Sun and Moon  was subsequently banned, and an attempt by  Khaenri'ahn  agents to steal the book for its secrets was thwarted. [23]   Orobashi's sacrifice took the form of leading a doomed war against the Raiden Shoguns  Makoto  and  Ei . This decision was also spurred by Watatsumi Island's lack of natural resources, which led its people to set its eyes on conquering  Yashiori Island , which was under the Raiden Shoguns' jurisdiction. The war was disastrous for the Watatsumi people; Orobashi was executed by Ei's  Musou no Hitotachi  while most of the island's other prominent figures were also slain or otherwise disappeared. [24]  At the moment of its death, Orobashi turned its eyes up to the heavens in defiance. [25]   At some point, the Hydro Archon  Egeria  created \"life\" by transforming some of her  Oceanids  followers into humans by pouring water from the  Primordial Sea  into their blood vessels, to fulfill their desires of enjoying human lives. This act did not go unnoticed by the Heavenly Principles, who then punished Egeria and her creations with a \"original sin\" for creating \"life\" without permission and decreed a  prophecy  that the waters would rise to dissolve Fontanians, leaving the Hydro Archon alone. [26]  Egeria did not want her followers to be harmed, and thus appointed one of her fellow Oceanid follower  Focalors  to succeed her when the time has come.    Cataclysm [ ]   500 years ago, a surge of forbidden knowledge [27]  emerged from  Khaenri'ah , wreaking havoc on both Khaenri'ah and Teyvat. The Seven, with the exception of  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata  who was tasked with defending Irminsul, were gathered to combat the threat from Khaenri'ah. [6]  One battle took place at  Tunigi Hollow , where the first Hydro Archon  Egeria  was slain; the remains of her consciousness and power were transformed into the  Harvisptokhm  by Rukkhadevata [28]  and used as a seal over the hollow to prevent more Abyssal power from infiltrating Teyvat. The other Seven, at some point, entered the depths of Khaenri'ah, where Electro Archon  Raiden Makoto  was slain. [29]   \"The gods\" ultimately destroyed Khaenri'ah, [30]  although The Seven may have been unwillingly involved. [31]  The Khaenri'ahns who managed to survive were cursed; pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were cursed with immortality, while others — those who came from Teyvat or those who descended from mixed-blood marriages — were given the \"curse of wilderness,\" which transformed them into various entities, which were mostly hilichurls. [32]  Several of The Seven were jaded by the events of the cataclysm; the new Electro Archon  Ei , Makoto's twin sister, broke ties with the Heavenly Principles and soon left her Gnosis in  Yae Miko 's possession, [33] [34]  while the  Tsaritsa  joined forces with former Khaenri'ahn royal mage [35]   Pierro  to establish the Fatui. [36]   The Traveler's sibling, who appeared in Khaenri'ah after \"the heavens responded to the summoning\" [35]  and became the  (‍ Princess Princess Text for male Traveler / Prince Prince Text for female Traveler ‍)  of Khaenri'ah, [37]  was horrified by the destruction. They tried to flee this world, waking up the Traveler and getting as far as Celestia [Note 4]  when they were intercepted and sealed away by the unknown god.  Somehow, the Traveler's sibling ended up traveling Teyvat, sometimes with  Dainsleif . The sibling eventually became the leader of the  Abyss Order , an organization established by  Chlothar Alberich  which worships a certain self-proclaimed \" Sinner \" [38]  and aims to destroy the Heavenly Principles by engulfing the \"thrones\" with the  Abyss . [39] [40]  Dainsleif, however, opposes them and believes that rousing the gods' ire will only repeat Khaenri'ah's past mistakes. [30]   Following Egeria's death during the Cataclysm, Focalors succeeded her as the Hydro Archon. Thrust with the looming prophecy, she sought to find a way to deceive the Heavenly Principles while fulfilling it at the same time in order to protect her people. Focalors decided on a plan in which she split herself into two halves - her \"divinity\" which kept the Hydro Gnosis, and her \"humanity\" named  Furina , who she tasked with act as the Hydro Archon to keep her true identity a secret, or the plan would fail. In the subsequent trials hosted at the  Opera Epiclese , Focalors would accumulate the Indemntium to create a massive sword which she would use to execute herself with to destroy the Divine Throne of Hydro, while a small portion powered Fontaine's energy needs. She also came into contact with the reborn  Hydro Dragon ,  Neuvillette , and had him serve as her Iudex; one to return his Authority to him when she executed herself, and also hoping that his new perspectives of humanity would make him want to save her people. Neuvillette was not aware of this at the time but accepted out of a need to find answers for himself, while Furina was successful in duping the masses for the next 500 years.    Present Day [ ]   The Traveler woke up 500 years after being sealed by the Unknown God and eventually met  Paimon . After learning about some of Teyvat's language and history from her, the two decide to search for The Seven and find their sibling, thus starting the events of the game.  The Traveler also attempts to find information about Khaenri'ah and the disaster they witnessed, but finds little relevant information before meeting Dainsleif. While the Heavenly Principles has been silent for the past 500 years, [2]  most of The Seven are still reluctant or unable to give information about forbidden subjects. [9] [41]    In  Raiden Shogun 's  Story Quest ,  Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter : Act II -  Transient Dreams , Makoto's consciousness is briefly reawakened in the chaotic space of her  realm of consciousness . She gave Ei a seed of light — the yet-unplanted  Sacred Sakura  — and describes it with: \"Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within. \"When both shine in unison, the Sacred Sakura blooms from the darkness, finally free from the clutches of the Heavenly Principles. \"Now, the nightmare has dissipated, and reality is made whole. The vision we both yearn for is still further ahead.\"   Ei suspects that a \"higher power\" — namely  Istaroth , one of the Heavenly Principles's  Four Shades  — was involved in creating the Sacred Sakura, and that it was not Makoto's power alone. [42]   During  Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies , Lesser Lord Kusanali bluffs  Il Dottore  into making a concession in exchange for the Electro Gnosis by threatening to destroy it, damage the \"laws,\" [2]  and potentially awaken the Heavenly Principles. [6]   When the Traveler arrived at Fontaine, rumors of the prophecy began to manifest after the general public learned about the Primordial Water that could dissolve them as a result of  Marcel's  use of it in the serial disappearances case and a public dissolving of the  Garde   Vaughn  to stop him from leaking his identity. Throughout the events of Fontaine's Archon Quests, the Traveler and Neuvillette were able to discern the truth about the prophecy and their origins, putting Furina on trial in an attempt to know her secrets to stop it. Just as Furina's identity was compromised, Focalors had accumulated enough Indemntium to execute herself, shattering the Divine Throne of Hydro and restoring Neuvillette's Authority. The prophecy was still fulfilled as professed, but as Neuvillette had absolved the Fontanians' sins, making them \"true\" humans being immune to dissolution, they did not dissolve and Focalors' death satisfied the Heavenly Principles' demand, [26]  despite the destruction of the Divine Throne of Hydro. The Heavenly Principles did not react to its destruction, leading to the  Traveler's Sibling  to believe that it was proof of their \"situation,\" though they were unsure as to when or how they would awaken. [43]   When  Mavuika  channeled the power of six ancient heroes (whose  Ancient Names  had been passed down to their modern counterparts) and  Ronova 's power to stop the Abyss' invasion of the nation, the sheer power of the attack briefly revealed a \"false sky\" and several strange fragments floating before it was quickly covered up. The Traveler later asked Mavuika about it, who knew that it warranted investigation as it had never been seen anywhere else on Teyvat. She believed that the Heavenly Principles wished to keep the matter a secret and hoped that they would not cause her too much trouble for revealing it. [44]     Character Mentions [ ]   Character Stories Character Stories Neuvillette Character Story 5   Trivia [ ]   In the  Manga 's  Prologue  chapter,  Venti  envisions three enigmatic, shadowy figures when  Vennessa  asks him to tell her about Celestia. He visibly grows uncomfortable and immediately deflects the question, leaving their identities unknown. Given that the Heavenly Principles was already in control of Celestia before Venti ascended to godhood and became one of The Seven 2,600 years ago, [45]  these three figures are likely connected to the Heavenly Principles in some way.   The description of  Staff of the Scarlet Sands  begins with a creation story, which may be about the world's reconstruction after the divine nails were cast down. King Deshret narrates that \"the seven sage monks were established again, and they ruled the trajectories drawn by the earth, water, and stars,\" which may refer to the seven divine thrones now occupied by The Seven and the association of constellations with Vision-bearers. [46]  His comment immediately after, \"Even if the celestial sphere was just an illusion [...]\" may allude to the rumor of the  False Sky .   During  Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved  in  Zhongli 's  Story Quest ,  Historia Antiqua Chapter : Act II -  No Mere Stone , Zhongli says \"People abandon and surrender the things they love to pursue the right path. Perhaps this is the erosion imposed on me by the Heavenly Principles.\" The term \"Heavenly Principles\" was revised from its initial translation as \"natural order\" since the original text specifically marked it as a proper noun, but this ends up losing the tie-in to an earlier remark by  Kun Jun  (possessed by  Azhdaha ) about how \"Everything returns to dust. It is the natural order, an unstoppable force.\" This instance of \"natural order\" uses the same characters as the Heavenly Principles, but did not specifically mark the term as a proper noun. If the phrase is read as a proper noun, the original Chinese version can be translated as \"Erosion is the Heavenly Principles' dominion, an unreachable power.\" ( Chinese :  「磨损」是天理之所在，力不能及。 )   The Heavenly Principles may be the creator who has not yet returned, mentioned in the  Traveler 's  Character Details .   In  Hilichurlian , the word \" unu \" means \"one\" and is also a holy word that is used for the  hilichurls ' concept of gods and the origin of life. [47]  While no direct connection has been made between hilichurls, the single unified civilization that once existed across the world and the Heavenly Principles, the hilichurls' gravitation to ancient ruins has been observed [48]  and their link between the concepts of \"one\" and \"god\" has not been perpetuated in human cultures on Teyvat.   The original Chinese version, as well as the Japanese and Korean versions, uses a polite expression for the Primordial One, probably indicating Enkanomiya historians' (and/or their society's) reverence toward this deity.   Etymology [ ]   The Chinese name for the Primordial One uses the character  原  \"original, primordial,\"  which is used in two other notable terms:  Allogenes  ( Chinese :  原神  \"Primordial God, Original God\" ), which is the game's namesake ( Genshin  is a romanization of the Japanese reading of the same word)   Primogem  ( Chinese :  原石  \"Primordial Stone\" ), an item which is described as something \"beyond the mundane world,\" and which \"shines with the condensed hopes and dreams of universes that once were.\"   In the Orphic tradition of Greek mythology,  Phanes  is the primeval god of creation and new life. According to legend, Phanes was an androgynous god who emerged from a  cosmic egg  created by  Chronos , intertwined with a serpent. As a god of light, he was the creator of daytime and linked with  Nyx , the goddess of night who created nighttime. Phanes was also said to be a dying and resurrecting god, killed by the Titans who devoured his flesh but rescued by Athena and resurrected by Zeus.   In Sethian Gnosticism,  Protophanes , also known as the \"First Appearing One\" is one of the three emanations of  Barbelo , the first thought of God, alongside  Kalyptos  \"The Hidden One\" and  Autogenes  \"The Self-Born One\".   Cultural Inspiration [ ]   Because of the  Gnostic  inspiration behind  Genshin Impact , comparisons have been made between the Heavenly Principles and the Gnostic figure  Demiurge  (or Yaldabaoth), a false god mistakenly created by Sophia (Wisdom) who went on to create the mortal world. The Demiurge's role and motivations vary between different Gnostic traditions, but the usual goal of Gnostics is to embrace their inner divinity through  gnosis  and ascend from the mortal world to reunite with the true god  Monad  in the  Pleroma .  In  Sethian  Gnosticism, the Biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden — in which the two succumb to the serpent's temptation and eat the forbidden fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil — is depicted as a good thing, as it was the first step towards freedom from Yaldabaoth. In Nabu Malikata's account, the Heavenly Principles sent down the divine nails out of fear towards the \"rising tide of delusion and breakthroughs\" caused by forbidden knowledge, and technology made using forbidden knowledge is capable of surpassing the world's \"laws.\"   Most Gnostic traditions believe that there are seven archons for the seven planets (or celestial spheres) which prevent the soul from leaving the material realm, and one must ascend each of the seven planets before they can escape the mortal realm and return to the Pleroma. This concept was likely inspiration for the Traveler's journey through the Seven Nations, with the suggestion that they will ascend [49]  at the end of the story. However, the Demiurge is usually one of the seven archons in Gnostic belief, whereas the Heavenly Principles is separate from, and is above, the Seven Archons of Teyvat.   Notes [ ]     ↑   天理   Tiānlǐ , \"Heavenly Principles,\" lit. \"Heaven's law, natural order\"  was used in  Genshin Impact Story Teaser: We Will Be Reunited  and  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail , but they were inconsistently localized into English and were never redubbed. While this term was also inconsistently localized during earlier versions of the game, they have mostly been standardized to \"Heavenly Principles.\"     ↑   This article uses the singular pronoun \"it\" to refer to the Heavenly Principles, keeping in line with the English localization of  A Toast to Victory . The previous quest,  Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies , refers to the Heavenly Principles in the plural. By comparison, the original Chinese texts in both instances do not use any pronouns or otherwise indicate whether the Heavenly Principles is a single entity or multiple entities referred to as a collective.     ↑   One notable hilichurl member is a  Frostarm Lawachurl  found on  Dragonspine  whose displayed name is  Ukko .     ↑   It is assumed that the location of the siblings' fight against the unknown god is Celestia due to the prevalence of the  Celestial motif  in the area and the location seeming to be located in the sky.

    "Hilichurls": "Overview Culture Media   See also:  Hilichurlian       Hilichurls               Type   Enemy Families         Primitive humanoid monsters that can be found all across Teyvat. Most people have already given up on trying to communicate with the hilichurls, believing that they are monsters simply incapable of communication.   Hilichurls  are a goblin-like family of  monsters  in  Genshin Impact , and are one of the first enemy family types the player will encounter early in the game.

They appear to have two elongated ears sticking out of their mane. The only clothing they wear is a loincloth, while their arms and legs are loosely wrapped in bandages. Every Hilichurl wears a mask, as to prevent themselves from seeing their own hideous faces in reflections. While elementally-affiliated Hilichurls, such as Samachurls, Hilichurl Rogues and Lawachurls take on the color of their element, their skin is naturally of a grayish-black hue.  Elementally affiliated hilichurls, such as  Samachurls  and  Lawachurls , also take on the element's appropriate color for both their skin and masks. Despite their general hostility towards outsiders or humans and a less than optimal lifestyle, Hilichurls are also intelligent for their standards, as a few use tools and  Slimes , scavenge and even engage in agriculture, albeit limited to raising livestock due to the race's general dislike of vegetables. They have a fairly impressive, albeit archaic architectural style, the construction or purpose of them unknown.   As a hilichurl grows and survives, they eventually turn into  Mitachurls , who are larger and bulkier. Mitachurls that continue to grow and survive eventually accumulate an excess of the elemental energy in their area, turning them into  Lawachurls . It is not known how long it takes for this growth to occur.  Some hilichurls may instead go rogue; unlike other hilichurls, these rogues are not part of a tribe, instead wandering around Teyvat for an unknown reason. However, they may occasionally help other hilichurl tribes for a short time before leaving. These hilichurls are larger, being of a similar height to a mitachurl, and are also said to be intelligent for hilichurl standards.  They appear to not have an archon or god governing them, rather relying on the most strongest and ferocious among them to lead the tribe. Most tribes also have  Samachurls  who act as the spiritual leaders of the group. The Lawachurls whose name is derived from the Hilichurlian way of respectfully addressing a king or ruler are revered by younger Hilichurls due to their strength. Despite their status as a role model or \"king\" for the smaller hierarchy, most Lawachurls prefer solitude.  Hilichurls appear to have a reliable social network, as some Hilichurls are friends with others across vast distances. [1]  Like humans, Hilichurls can live in a myriad of environments and acclimate themselves accordingly.  Many Hilichurls are also affiliated with the  Abyss Order , as the  Abyss Mages  are able to speak fluent Hilichurlian. Unlike humans, who usually have to rely on a  Vision  or science to manipulate the elements, some Hilichurls are naturally capable of doing so, such as the samachurls — why or how is unknown. That said, Hilichurls typically stay away from areas with high elemental concentrations, as it places a great burden on their body.

A tribe's composition tends to vary, usually containing a large amount of normal hilichurls. Most tribes also have Samachurls, who are the oldest of the Hilichurls and often lead the tribes.  Some tribes may not have Samachurls, which is the result of younger, stronger members overthrowing them. These tribes are most likely led by Mitachurls and are far more aggressive. Even fewer tribes are led by Lawachurls, as the few that are around prefer solitude and dislike the reverence the younger members give them.    Sleeper Tribe [ ]   The Sleeper Tribe Hilichurls are known for napping whenever possible. Due to their emphasis on sleeping, the Sleeper Tribe is rumored to have extremely soft animal-skin beds.    Meaty Tribe [ ]   The Meaty Tribe Hilichurls are known for making sacrifices on a regular basis. They pray for meat every day and highly value strength. Apart from building huge altars, they possess a massive cooking pot and a huge arena for members of the tribe to spar.    Eclipse Tribe [ ]   The Hilichurls of the Eclipse Tribe are said to be extremely mysterious; all Hilichurls of that tribe know how to draw an eclipse symbol. It is rumored that the Dada Samachurls of this tribe know the reasoning behind this.    Lore [ ]   It is heavily implied that hilichurls were once human beings who were cursed by the Gods for \"sinning.\" While the punishment of the Gods could take many forms (such as immortality), this particular affliction is known as the \"curse of wilderness,\" which causes people to transform into monsters and grants them an unnaturally prolonged life. Given that the Hilichurls' existence has been known for over a thousand years, it is likely they originate from the many ancient civilizations that once thrived on Teyvat before their eventual demise in various catastrophic events across  Teyvat 's history. In particular, their presence has increased since the  cataclysm  occurring 500 years ago, [3]  coinciding with the destruction of the ancient human civilization of  Khaenri'ah . In fact,  Dainsleif  confirms that the hilichurls encountered in the Chasm are actually former citizens of Khaenri'ah, [4] [Note 1]  and  Chlothar Alberich  further reveals that those who were not \"pure-blood Khaenri'ahns\" were the ones that turned into monsters. [5]   Due to the curse, memories of their former life are gradually forgotten, as well as most semblances of humanity they once had. Their intelligence and behavior are gradually degraded, and they can no longer speak nor understand the common language of Teyvat. Despite all this, Hilichurls still seem to be capable of at least some rudimentary self-awareness and emotion. For instance, they still recall what it was like to have a human face, as the reason they wear masks to hide their true countenance is because they cannot stand the mental anguish of seeing their own hideous reflections in a body of water. [6]   Although most Hilichurls are incapable of human speech and intelligence, it is possible to reverse parts of the curse, such as when  Caribert  was able to speak again after being imbued with the power of the abyss from the statue of the  Sinner . [7]  Moreover, in  Fontaine ,  Narzissenkreuz  was able to give an  Anemo Hilichurl Rogue  sentience, granting him both a \"human\" form and the ability to speak and understand human language, giving him the name  Caterpillar . [8]   Hilichurls are unable to truly die a natural death on account of their immortality; as they grow older, their physical bodies and mental state erode to the point that is like 'death'. Because of this, aged Hilichurls are in a state of perpetual agony. However, Hilichurls seem to know that they are cursed and are also somehow aware of the properties of an area in  The Chasm  that can temporarily assuage the effects of their curse. Therefore, some Hilichurls instinctively venture to this region when they want to 'die' — ignoring all bodily needs of food or defense, and desiring nothing else than to waste away with at least some semblance of comfort.    Trivia [ ]   It is not confirmed who or what the hilichurls from more than 500 years ago are. However, there is a  Frostarm Lawachurl  enemy on  Dragonspine  who is named  Ukko , suggesting that Khaenri'ah is not the only destroyed civilization with people who turned into hilichurls.  It seems that Hilichurls have an affinity for remnants of the past. [9]   After the fall of the ancient city of  Gurabad , which involved Abyssal powers, its people were said to have been \"scattered amidst a world of darkness, left to become wild creatures who had lost their language and faces.\" This description shares some similarities with the behavior of Hilichurls. [10]             A traditional depiction of an Amanojaku       Hilichurls may be inspired by a type of  oni  called  Amanojaku  ( Japanese :  天邪鬼  \"heavenly evil spirit\" ). It is also called a  jaki  ( Japanese :  邪鬼 ) in some branches of Buddhism. These creatures are also the inspiration for the main enemy type in the game  Ōkami , which also wear masks.   The word  Hilifolk  may be intended as a collective synonym for Hilichurls; the term is written in the  Teyvat alphabet  on the covers of  Hilichurl Cultural Customs  and the  Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian .  Hilichurls are also called \"hill devils\", but  Ella Musk  calls them \"hill dwellers\" instead. [11]   A tribe in Dadaupa Gorge called the Eclipse tribe worships an object that appears to represent an eclipsed sun. The tribe or the object might be a reference to the now fallen  Eclipse Dynasty  in  Khaenri'ah .   Hilichurls seem to recite poems or songs, according to Jacob Musk. These range from expressions of grief, festivity, and so on. [12]   The  manga  depicts beings resembling Hilichurls that existed during the time of  Vennessa , though they are different in appearance compared to their present-day counterparts. For example, they are shown to have more colorful masks, and could be seen using traditional bows instead of the crossbows now wielded by Hilichurl Shooters. Notably, there was also a kind of flying creature with bat-like wings that is not known to appear in any other media. [13]   None of the hilichurl designs seen in the prologue appear afterwards. However, Chapter 5 of the manga depicts hilichurls in present-day with Amber. These hilichurls have the same design used in-game and in official media.   An unarmed Hilichurl will throw rocks with their left, suggesting that it's supposed to be also used by Hilichurl Fighters (who wield clubs with their right).   If a Pyro Hilichurl Grenadier attempts to dig out a slime in shallow water, they will humorously show up empty handed while looking on with confusion. Cryo Hilichurl Grenadiers can successfully do so. However, and interestingly, the Cryo slimes they dig up appear to be Frozen.   In some areas of Sumeru and during specific one-time off events and commissions, players may encounter unconscious hilichurls laying on the ground, most often near active dangerous enemies. These always utilize the normal, plain hilichurl model and can be seen moving when examined up close.   The people of Sumeru's desert historically referred to hilichurls as \"majuj\" ( Arabic :  مَأْجُوجُ ). [14] [15]   Notes [ ]     ↑   After Dainsleif explains that the effect of the curse he had been suffering from ever since the cataclysm seems to be weakened while near the  Inverted City , the Traveler can ask Dainsleif, \"The hilichurls that come here are also from...\" Dainsleif's response is, \"Indeed. Do you know why hilichurls wear masks? [...] It's to hide their appearance, lest they catch sight of their reflection in a body of water... Compared to how they remember themselves, it is a terrible sight to behold, one that causes them great despair.\" after which the Traveler replies, \"So these hilichurls really are from...\" Although the Traveler left the place of origin of the hilichurls found in The Chasm unsaid, this conversation strongly implies that they are from Khaenri'ah.

It's said the Ley Lines remember all things that happen in this world, from the surface down to the deepest depths... Loading Screen   The  Ley Lines  are a network of elemental energy and memories of everything that has lived in  this world , both on the surface and down in the  Abyss .

These deposits are generated from the impeded flow of elemental energy, and use people's wills as their fertile soil in which to grow. They feed on elemental energy and can be revitalized with  Original Resin  in order to receive treasures. [2] [3] [4]   In  Domains , Petrified Trees (extensions of  Irminsul ) are the instruments through which the Ley Lines flow. As the domains are built around these trees, the overwhelming elemental energy that surges through them causes  Ley Line Disorders , which make the elements behave in an unpredictable way. Just like the blossoms, these trees can be revitalized with Original Resin to receive treasures. [5] [6]   Disturbances in the Ley Lines can allow others to experience the memories flowing within them. [7]   Originally,  Natlan  had Ley Lines of its own [8] , but these were destroyed during the ancient wars between the  Heavenly Principles  and the  dragons . An Angel,  Yohualtecuhtin , instead used the remnants of these Ley Lines and constructed a variant of the Ley Lines called the  Night Kingdom , which acts as a substitute. Because of this, memories in Natlan are incompatible with those from other areas of Teyvat and vice versa [9] , and their nearly non-existent Ley Lines (of which any remaining are unstable and not deep-rooted) have made the nation particularly vulnerable to the  Abyss .    Story [ ]   During the events of  Archon Quest   Chapter III : Act VI -  Caribert , the  Abyss Order 's tampering with the Ley Lines in  Avidya Forest  cause the  Traveler  to fall unconscious and witness  their sibling's  memories from centuries ago, particularly of meeting  Chlothar  and  his son .  The Loom of Fate, created by Caribert and the Abyss Order, is a device capable of weaving Ley Lines. In its incomplete form, it could only be used to create and implant memories. After the Abyss Order obtained the eye of the first  Field Tiller , the Loom of Fate was completed and now has the power to weave real Ley Lines of its own. However, creating new Ley Lines can neither \"replace\" nor \"extend\" pre-existing ones. [10]     Trivia [ ]   The concept originates from the pseudoscientific belief that historical sites and landmarks are interconnected along deliberate alignments called \" ley lines \", which are thought to be paths channeling spiritual energy.

Type   Lore Locations       The  Abyss , also known as the  Void Realm , is a term which refers to three interconnected concepts:    As the Void Realm, it is one of the three  realms  in the world of  Teyvat , alongside the  Human Realm  and the  Light Realm . While the Human Realm and Light Realms are capable of adjusting to accommodate each other's existences, the Void Realm is devastating to both.

The Void Realm's dark currents are analogous to the Human Realm's  Ley Lines  and the Light Realm's elemental currents. Its darkness is extremely harmful towards elemental beings such as  Vishaps  and elemental dragons, although they are capable of repelling the darkness by harnessing the Light Realm's power. [2]   The Abyss' darkness is described as the only kind of power that could dye  Morax 's stone pillars black. [1]   Venti , another  Archon , was poisoned by  Durin 's Abyss-laced blood when his attempt to connect with  Dvalin  was interrupted by the  Traveler ; only by visiting the  Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero  at  Windrise  could Venti expunge the Abyssal poison from himself. [6]  The rest of Durin's blood was spilt in  Dragonspine , where it crystallized into  Crimson Agate , a substance capable of reviving the  Frostbearing Tree , which died thousands of years ago after the  Skyfrost Nail  dropped from Celestia. Previous attempts to revive the tree failed, indicating that Durin's blood had special properties. [7]   Prolonged exposure to the Abyss can drastically change a person's personality or corrupt their entire being. [5] [8] [9]  Humans exposed to Abyssal energy will slowly begin to decay over time; even with treatment, large amounts of Abyssal energy will result in death. The  Traveler  has the ability to purify Abyssal energy to some degree.  The Abyss appears to be attracted to — and draws in — those with great ambition, such as  Rhinedottir  and  Tartaglia . Those who have personal ties to the Abyss have been known to gain an uncanny ability to wreak havoc and conflict. [4] [10]   Tsumi  believes that the Abyss Order finds the Void Realm's power addictive. [2]   The Abyss appears to have a mind of its own to the point that it could be considered an entity;  Kitsune Saiguu  refers to it as such [11] , while during the  cataclysm  and events of Natlan's Archon Quests, the Abyss tailored its events to each of the six tribes and increased the frequency of its attacks as Mavuika's plan progressed. [12]   Denizens of the Abyss appear to use an  Enochian-based language , based on the text that can be seen above  Abyss Mages ' heads when talking to  Hilichurls  and in their  Adventurer Handbook  description. Abyss monsters also have the ability to manipulate elemental energy without the use of  Visions .   Time in the Abyss passes differently than it does in Teyvat; Tartaglia spent three months in there, but returned to a Teyvat that had only seen three days pass since his disappearance. [4]  When  Takamine the Mistsplitter  finally emerged from the Abyss, a long time had passed on Teyvat and  Asase Hibiki  was \"no longer young.\" [13]  It is unclear whether this time scale disparity is consistent, or if it can change depending on certain factors.

[5]   The  Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah , among whom is \"The Visionary\"  Vedrfolnir  who inspired  Chlothar  to form the Abyss Order.   Abyss Order [ ]   Main article:  Abyss Order   The  Abyss Order  is an organization comprised mostly of non-human beings that harness both the elements and Abyssal power, seeking to ruin Teyvat as retaliation for the  cataclysm  500 years ago. Its members are former citizens of  Khaenri'ah  who were transformed into monsters through a yet unclear process, speculated to be the divine punishment of the  Heavenly Principles  and other gods of Celestia, such as the  Unknown God . After being separated by the  Unknown God , the  Traveler's Sibling  has also become the leader of the Abyss Order. The Abyss Order usually conscripts  Hilichurls  and  Abyss Mages  to do their work.    Story [ ]   Ancient History [ ]   According to legend, when the  Heavenly Principles  descended on the world, it created the Human Realm after defeating the  Seven Sovereigns  of the Light Realm, subjugating both nature and those of the Light Realm who hadn't escaped into the ocean. [14] [15]   During the war between the Heavenly Principles and the  Second Who Came , the region of  Enkanomiya  fell into the ocean depths, where the forces of the Light Realm and the Void Realm already existed. With the addition of a Human Realm aspect, the Vishaps who had fled into the oceans grew hostile towards the stranded people and were only fended off through the creation of the  Dainichi Mikoshi  and later, the intervention of the  god   Orobashi . The people of Enkanomiya built the Towers of the Three Realms to regulate the powers of the Human Realm, Light Realm, and Void Realm. These towers, known as  Kunado's Locus ,  Yachimatahiko's Locus , and  Yachimatahime's Locus , were hidden using techniques only known by shrine maidens and the  Vassals of Watatsumi . [16] [17]     The Cataclysm [ ]   At some point, five prominent individuals from Khaenri'ah;  Surtalogi ,  Rhinedottir ,  Vedrfolnir ,  Hroptatyr  and  Rerir  became tempted by the call of the Abyss and discovered a massive source of power from it that could destroy Teyvat. They shared it among themselves, becoming the  Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah , but also transcendent beings with \"world-shattering\" power. [18]   Five hundred years ago, during the cataclysm, the fall of Khaenri'ah's  Eclipse Dynasty  came at the hands of the gods. The \"great sinner\" Rhinedottir, also known as Gold, created an enormous amount of monsters containing Abyssal power. These monsters proceeded to ravage Teyvat, causing widespread destruction. [10] [19]  It is unclear whether the gods' attack on Khaenri'ah came before or after her actions, but the two events are inextricably linked. Following the destruction of Khaenri'ah, the pure-blooded inhabitants, seen as greater \"sinners\", were cursed with immortality, whereas the non-pure, or lesser \"sinners\", who came from mixed blood were instead cursed to become various monsters such as  hilichurls ,  Abyss Mages ,  Abyss Heralds  or  Abyss Lectors . [20]   When the great beast  Elynas  arrived in  Fontaine , many Abyssal sea creatures also emerged with it; Elynas' presence caused severe pollution to the nation's land and water. The Fontaine Armada was recalled to tackle the beast, during which they pursued Elynas over the course of 35 days while attracting all types of Abyssal creatures in the process. Elynas had begun to bleed from unknown wounds and eventually died; through his remains and the power of the Abyss, the  Breacher Primus  species who still roam the remains of Elynas were created.  In  Natlan , the Abyss caused more damage during the cataclysm due to the nation's lack of stable, deep-rooted Ley Lines, seemingly adjusting their attacks to each tribe. Eventually they were temporarily repelled by the  Pyro Archon   Mavuika  and several ancient heroes of the time;  Tenoch ,  Sundjatta ,  Sanhaj ,  Burkina ,  Tupac ,  Wanjiru  and  Menilek . Knowing the Abyss would return into the future, Mavuika drafted a plan that would require the  Ancient Name  bearers to pass their names down in the future while the tribes rebuilt, and the  Wayob  would send their hero when the time came to indicate that the tribe was ready to fight. However, the Abyss became aware of the plan and infiltrated the Night Kingdom, slowly infecting it and the Wayobs within them to prevent it from being passed down. This worked to some degree, as only three of the tribes were ready by the time she awoke 500 years later, while the other three did not appear to be aware of the plan.  Meanwhile, to keep the Abyss at bay, the  Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame  and  Night Warden Wars  were conducted to produce Contending Fire, a source of energy to fuel the Sacred Flame. The Sacred Flame would keep a majority of the Abyss at bay as long as it was not extinguished. During the Night Warden Wars, which sent Ancient Name bearers into the Night Kingdom to fight the Abyss, they would occasionally win the battle by adapting and adjusting tactics.    Present [ ]   When Tartaglia was fourteen, he ran away from  home , and after falling into a deep hole, he found himself in the Abyss. There, he encountered a swordswoman, [4]   Skirk , [21]  who trained him, taught him to navigate the Abyss, and nurtured his ability to raise endless conflict no matter where he went. [4]   When  Scaramouche  joined the  Fatui  and had his seal unlocked by  Il Dottore , the  Tsaritsa  and  Pierro  would have him lead expeditions into the Abyss. Whatever he found there promoted him into the Sixth of the  Fatui Harbinger , though following this promotion he was ordered to be on standby.  After the Traveler retrieves the  Bloodbranch Coral  so  Sangonomiya Kokomi  could perform the  Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri , a ritual used to reverse  Watatsumi Island 's  Holy Soil  phenomenon. However, unexpectedly, the phenomenon failed to reverse and merely halted. Concerned, the Divine Priestess sent a team to investigate, only to discover that Enkanomiya was shrouded in a mysterious darkness. [2]  This darkness turned out to be the encroachment of the Void Realm, instigated by  Enjou , who convinced the  Bathysmal Vishaps  to disrupt the Towers of the Three Realms in favor of the Void Realm. The vishaps, eager to overthrow human presence, complied, only to discover that they were even more susceptible to Abyssal power.  Tsumi  went to the  Watatsumi troops  in the guise of a shrine maiden to aid in repelling the Void Realm, rescue the vishaps trapped under the  Dainichi Mikoshi , and perhaps even destroy the tower. Although she succeeds in her former two goals, she ultimately finds herself unable to carry through with her last objective. [22]   When the Traveler arrived at Natlan, they learned about the peoples' history with the Abyss and how they continually fought against them. After one  Night Warden War , the Abyss attacked the  People of the Springs , but the attack was repulsed by the tribe. Nonetheless, it served as a warning for the other tribes to prepare for the possibility of attack. Kachina failed to return from the war despite the usage of the  Ode of Resurrection  (as the team had won), prompting Mavuika to suspend further pilgrimages and wars until the situation could be resolved. A group consisting of  Mualani ,  Iansan ,  Chasca  and the Traveler entered the Night Kingdom and rescued Kachina, while removing some corruption from the  Children of Echoes ' Wayob. The Abyss attempted to swallow the group whole and managed to close an exit back to the surface, but Mavuika saved the group by sacrificing her keepsakes to break into the Night Kingdom. [23]   Eventually, another hero was discovered by  Ororon  after he had a new desire to continue living, prompting the Abyss to increase the frequency of their attacks upon realizing he was one of the two heroes that had not been found yet. The Abyss soon enacted a full-scale invasion of the entire nation, particularly in the  Flower-Feather Clan  as their hero had yet to be discovered. The invasion initially appeared to have trouble getting a foothold, but the Abyss soon ramped up the invasion and began dropping more dangerous monsters, slowly beginning to overwhelm the defenses all over the nation. Eventually, the final hero was discovered as  Chasca  after she accepted the grief of losing  Chuychu , and with all six heroes now found, Mavuika channeled their and  Ronova 's power to end the invasion for good. She could sense that the Abyss had retreated to the depths of the Night Kingdom, and asked the Traveler to accompany her when the time came to stomp the Abyss out of Natlan for good. [24]     Trivia [ ]   The Abyss is the only enemy group that does not have any  Common Enemies .   The color of  Marana's Avatar  and the effects of  Marana , or the  The Withering , on Teyvat implied that \" forbidden knowledge \" has some link to the Abyss.  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata  confirmed that the \"forbidden knowledge\" originated from the very bottom of the Abyss, which also doesn't belong to Teyvat.   Etymology [ ]   In both English and Chinese, the term \"abyss\" ( Chinese :  深渊   Shēnyuān , lit. \"deep abyss\" ), can refer to a literal bottomless (or unfathomably deep) pit, or used in a figurative sense to refer to a catastrophic or destructive situation. [25] [26] [27]   The Chinese name for the Void Realm is  虚无界 , which is similar to but distinct from the \"Void\" used in  Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records , which is  虚空 . As adjectives, both can mean \"empty\" or \"void,\" but as nouns,  虚无  means \"nothingness\" whereas  虛空  means \"empty space\" or \"sky.\"   Other Languages [ ]     Language Official Name Literal Meaning English Abyss — Chinese (Simplified) 深渊 Shēnyuān Deep Abyss Chinese (Traditional) 深淵 Shēnyuān Japanese アビス Abisu Abyss Korean 심연 심연 深淵 Simyeon Abyss Spanish Abismo Abyss French Ab î me Abyss Russian Бездна Bezdna Abyss Thai Abyss — Vietnamese Vực Sâu Abyss German Abgrund Abyss Indonesian Abyss — Portuguese Abismo Abyss Turkish Hi ç lik Abyss Italian Abisso Abyss   Change History [ ]   Introduced in  Version 1.0 [ Create New History ]   References [ ]     ↑  1.0   1.1   Weapon Ascension Material:  Piece of Aerosiderite     ↑  2.0   2.1   2.2   2.3   Event  Three Realms Gateway Offering  Quest,  Aphotic Diffusal :  Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve     ↑   Weapon Ascension Material:  Bit of Aerosiderite     ↑  4.0   4.1   4.2   4.3   4.4   Tartaglia's Character Story:  Character Story 4     ↑  5.0   5.1   5.2   Weapon Ascension Material:  Mask of the Kijin     ↑   Archon Quest, Prologue, Act II -  For a Tomorrow Without Tears , Part 4:  Let the Wind Lead     ↑   Weapon Lore:  Frostbearer     ↑   Tartaglia's Character Story:  Character Story 5     ↑   Artifact, Shimenawa's Reminiscence:  Shaft of Remembrance He will eventually return to me, even if he were to be [...] turned into a fierce beast by that dark defilement...     ↑  10.0   10.1   Book:  Breeze Amidst the Forest ,  Vol. 1     ↑   Weapon Lore:  Hakushin Ring \"So then, the dark will that gnaws at me...\"     ↑   Archon Quest, Chapter V, Act IV -  The Rainbow Destined to Burn , Part 3:  The Surging Darkness     ↑   Weapon Lore:  Thundering Pulse     ↑   Book:  The Byakuyakoku Collection , Vol. 2 -  Before Sun and Moon     ↑   Loading Screen Tip:  Light Realm     ↑   Book:  The Byakuyakoku Collection , Vol. 3 -  Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku     ↑   World Quest, Erebos' Secret:  The Three Great Martial Trials     ↑   Archon Quest, Chapter IV, Act VI -  Bedtime Story , Part 2:  Memories That Should Not Exist     ↑   Weapon Ascension Material:  Chunk of Aerosiderite     ↑   Archon Quest, Chapter I, Act IV -  We Will Be Reunited , Part 4:  A Soul Set Apart     ↑   Tartaglia's Voice-Over:  About Skirk     ↑   Event  Three Realms Gateway Offering  Quest,  Aphotic Diffusal :  Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath     ↑   Archon Quest, Chapter V, Act II -  Black Stone Under a White Stone , Part 4:  Into Eternal Night     ↑   Archon Quest, Chapter V, Act IV -  The Rainbow Destined to Burn , Part 6:  A Fuel Named \"Fate\"     ↑   Wiktionary:  深渊     ↑   Wiktionary:  abyss     ↑   Cambridge Dictionary:  abyss  (Definition 2)       Navigation [ ]     Teyvat       Mondstadt   Brightcrown Mountains   Brightcrown Canyon Stormterror's Lair     Galesong Hill   Cape Oath Dadaupa Gorge Falcon Coast Musk Reef Windrise   Starfell Valley   Cider Lake Mondstadt City Starfell Lake Starsnatch Cliff Stormbearer Mountains Stormbearer Point Thousand Winds Temple Whispering Woods   Windwail Highland   Dawn Winery Springvale Wolvendom     Dragonspine   Entombed City - Ancient Palace Entombed City - Outskirts Skyfrost Nail Snow-Covered Path Starglow Cavern Wyrmrest Valley       Unreleased   Dornman Port             Liyue   Bishui Plain   Dihua Marsh Qingce Village Sal Terrae Stone Gate Wangshu Inn Wuwang Hill     Minlin   Cuijue Slope Huaguang Stone Forest Jueyun Karst Mt.

    "Realm_of_Consciousness": "Realm of Consciousness     Type   Lore       Region   Teyvat       A  realm of consciousness  is a domain built on a person's consciousness which is separate from the world of  Teyvat ; however, events that occur within a realm of consciousness can affect the outside world. Little is known about how realms of consciousness work, and  Yae Miko  describes them as \"very abstract concept[s]\" surrounded by chaos. [1]     Contents     1   Overview   2   Story     2.1   Makoto's   2.2   Lesser Lord Kusanali's   2.3   Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's       3   Trivia   4   Other Languages   5   Change History   6   See Also   7   References   8   Navigation       Overview [ ]   As its name suggests, a realm of consciousness is a physical space which contains a person's consciousness. It can be accessed via an entrance, which takes on a form that relates to its owner. The interior of a realm of consciousness is also influenced by its owner's memories.  A person's realm of consciousness can exist even after their physical body perishes, and the person can maintain their sense of self even after their death. However, such a realm cannot be preserved indefinitely, and the owner is unable to perceive the state of the outside world or the passage of time. [1]     Story [ ]   Makoto's [ ]   Makoto 's realm of consciousness was preserved by  Ei  after the former's death during the  cataclysm , [2]  and its entrance takes the form of a torii gate. Although Ei sealed the entrance,  the Shogun  eventually unlocked it when their wills opposed each other to allow them to fight each other at full strength. [3]  Unbeknownst to Ei, Makoto had used her realm of consciousness so Ei could one day understand her vision of \"Eternity,\" after which her remaining consciousness within the  Musou Isshin  would be awakened to give Ei the seed of the  Sacred Sakura . After Ei planted the Sacred Sakura in the realm of consciousness, it took root in Inazuma's past, allowing it to protect  Inazuma  by absorbing the filth from the cataclysm. Afterwards, Makoto's strength and consciousness was expended, and her realm of consciousness disappeared. [1]  The  Dream Sakura , which the  Traveler  obtained from Makoto's realm of consciousness, continues to exist in a quasi-physical form that can be seen but is intangible.    Lesser Lord Kusanali's [ ]   As part of the plan to rescue  Lesser Lord Kusanali  from her imprisonment in the  Sanctuary of Surasthana , the Traveler entered her realm of consciousness, as she had closed off her consciousness to prevent  Il Dottore  from accessing her mind via the  Akasha . The entrance to her realm of consciousness took the form of a newly sprouted tree branch. [4]     Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's [ ]   Greater Lord Rukkhadevata 's realm of consciousness was left behind after her death in the cataclysm and its entrance took the form of a Knowledge Capsule, which was opened after Lesser Lord Kusanali used the power of the Electro  Gnosis . The Gnosis provided some protection against the forbidden knowledge corruption in Rukkhadevata's remaining consciousness. Because Rukkhadevata herself had been contaminated by forbidden knowledge during the cataclysm, her connection to  Irminsul  meant that it could not be healed so long as the memory of her persisted. After Kusanali erased Rukkhadevata's existence and remaining consciousness, her realm of consciousness, which Kusanali now believed to be that of Irminsul from five hundred years ago, disappeared. Without Rukkhadevata's tainted existence, Irminsul was healed and everything caused by its contamination, such as  Eleazar , disappeared. [5]     Trivia [ ]   The English localization of the  Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto Materials ' descriptions refer to Makoto's realm of consciousness as the \"Plane of Euthymia,\" but it is never referred to as a \"Plane of Euthymia\" during the quests which involve it. The original Chinese text corresponding to it in the materials' descriptions is simply  净土   Jìngtǔ , \"Pure Land,\"  whereas Ei's Plane of Euthymia is almost always referred to as the proper noun  「一心净土」   Yīxīn Jìngtǔ , \"Pure Land of One Mind.\"   During the  Archon Quest   The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur  in  Chapter IV : Act V -  Masquerade of the Guilty ,  Neuvillette  meets  Focalors  in an unidentified space while the  Traveler  meets  Furina  in her inner world. Neither are explicitly referred to as realms of consciousness, but time in both spaces do not flow the same way as it does in reality, and they return to the real world at the same point in time that the preceding quest left off at.

    "Seven_Sovereigns": "Seven Sovereigns     Type   Factions Lore       The  Seven Sovereigns  are the seven strongest elemental  dragons  of their respective element. [1]  The original Seven Sovereigns ruled the old world and held the seven  elemental   Authorities , but lost both their status and part of their powers when the  Heavenly Principles  came to  Teyvat  and created a new order over the world. [2] [3]   The Sovereigns' stolen Authorities were eventually used as the basis for the  Archons ' Authorities, which are bound to The Seven's divine seats. [2]  As a result, the living Sovereigns cannot utilize their full abilities unless their corresponding Archon dies and returns their Authority to them.

The Seven Sovereigns were the mightiest among dragon-kind [1]  and ruled over the old world and its seven nations. [3]   When the  Heavenly Principles  appeared, it took part of the Sovereigns' authorities for itself. It and its  four shining shades  waged war against the Seven Sovereigns and after a long struggle, the Heavenly Principles vanquished the Seven Sovereigns, while those who refused to yield to the Heavenly Principles fled into the ocean depths. Afterwards, the world was remade to be suitable for humanity [3]  and the  Human Realm  was established by breaking down the raw, primordial elements. [1] [4]   With the original Seven Sovereigns' power fading away, a new generation is being born. [5]  However, because a Sovereign's dragonhood is intertwined with the elemental Authorities, which were used as the basis for the Archons' Authorities, none of the living Sovereigns can access their full abilities or memories of the old world until the Archon's divine seat is destroyed and their Authority returned. [2]  As of the end of the  Archon Quest   Chapter IV : Act V -  Masquerade of the Guilty , the Hydro Sovereign's authority has been fully restored. [6]   Sovereigns can only be born from dragons who are elementally pure. As such, the next Hydro Sovereign was not born from the  Bathysmal Vishaps , who strayed from their \"pure\"  Hydro  forms into \"impure\"  Cryo  and  Electro  variants. It is also possible for Sovereigns to be reborn in human form, as the current Hydro Sovereign takes on the form of  Neuvillette , due to the aforementioned impurity of the Bathysmal Vishap. [7]     Story [ ]   The Old World [ ]   From \"the dawn of time,\" the world belonged to the dragons. [8]  The world was led by the Seven Sovereigns and the Dragon King  Nibelung . [9] [10]  Each of the Seven Sovereigns held one of the seven elemental Authorities, and the world was divided among them. Their respective land was attuned to their elemental affinity. [3]   In  Sumeru ,  Apep  held the  Dendro  elemental Authority. They ruled over a lush, forested land while nurturing some of the most ancient and primordial beings known simply as  Dendro lifeforms . [11]   The  Hydro Dragon , in addition to holding the  Hydro  elemental Authority, also presided over the  Primordial Sea  and could be considered the original \"God of Life.\"  All life on the planet can trace its origins back to the Primordial Sea. Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as \"birthing waters\" or \"amniotic fluid.\" [12]  Life within the Primordial Sea was a collective rather than made up of individuals. [13]     Eternal Throne of the Heavens [ ]   After the Heavenly Principles's arrival and subsequent defeat of the Seven Sovereigns, otherworldly life forms were introduced to the planet and the creation of life no longer relied on the Primordial Sea. [3] [12]  However, the creation of  Egeria  was an exception; she was created as a replacement \"heart\" for the Primordial Sea using \"all original matter from this world, entirely without outside elements.\" [13]     The New World [ ]   After being defeated, Nibelung left Teyvat to obtain power that could rival the Heavenly Principles, eventually bringing  forbidden knowledge  to the world. With this power Nibelung waged a \"great war of vengeance\" [14]  against the Heavenly Principles for \"the right to shape the world.\" [9]  The damage that ensued was unprecedented and pushed the world to near collapse. Apep and other dragons fought alongside Nibelung, but ultimately they were unsuccessful in taking back power. [9]  Their efforts weren't entirely fruitless, however. By the war's end, the Heavenly Principles was severely weakened and could no longer single-handedly suppress the original order of the world. [14]   Because the Heavenly Principles was unable to continue suppressing the old world with its own absolute authority, it and another entity known only as \"the one who came after,\" used remains of the Third  Descender  and stole part of the Sovereigns' elemental Authorities to create the seven  Gnoses . After which the  Archon War  began to determine which gods would win one of these seven new thrones. [14] [Note 1]   To suppress the forbidden knowledge unleashed by Nibelung, the Heavenly Principles dropped  divine nails , drastically altering the environment and causing the demise of several human civilizations. In Sumeru, what had once been a lush forest turned to sand. To Apep, this heralded the end of the dragons' era. [9]     Post Cataclysm [ ]   Around 500 years ago, Neuvillette — the new Hydro Sovereign, born in human form as the  Enkanomiyans  had prophesized — was invited by the new Hydro Archon  Focalors  to become the Chief Justice of  Fontaine . [6]  Although initially uninterested in humanity, Neuvillette agreed in order to uncover of his missing memories regarding his powers. [15]     Present Day [ ]   In  Nahida 's  Story Quest ,  Sapientia Oromasdis Chapter : Act II -  Homecoming , the Dendro Archon  Lesser Lord Kusanali ,  Paimon , and the  Traveler  meet the Dendro Sovereign Apep. Despite Apep's initial hostility towards anyone related to the old world's usurpers, it calms down after the three successfully purge the forbidden knowledge eating away at it. While still dissatisfied with the current world order, it explains the Sovereigns' past to them and decides to simply observe humanity and the gods for the time being. [9]   During the events of  Archon Quest   Chapter IV : Act V -  Masquerade of the Guilty , the second-to-last Hydro Archon Focalors is put on trial for the \"original sin\" that the Heavenly Principles had declared on Egeria. This trial reveals that  Furina  is not the real Hydro Archon but rather, as the \"humanity\" of Focalors, who has played the role of the Archon for 500 years while Focalors orchestrates her plan to deceive the Heavenly Principles. However, a death sentence was issued, and Focalors soon reveals her plan to Neuvillette, saying that acquiring the stolen power of the Hydro Sovereign is not true to her ideal of justice. This plan becomes successful when the Indemnitium acquired through the  Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale  forms a giant blade that proceeds to execute her, resulting in the destruction of the Hydro Archon's throne. After Focalors' death, Neuvillette's original authority is returned to him, making him in absolute control of the Hydro element. [16]     Confirmed Sovereigns [ ]   Dendro Dragon:  Apep     Hydro Dragon :  Neuvillette     Nibelung   Trivia [ ]   Nibelung is a potential candidate for the identity of the  Second Who Came  due to similarities between the calamities ascribed to them and the necessary restructuring of the world after their defeats. [3]   Based on other  Genshin Impact  lore, the following characters may be Sovereigns:  Azhdaha    is theorized to be one of the Seven Sovereigns of the Vishap Realm, as he is stated to be extremely old and is an elemental dragon. [1] [17]  He is also referred to as a \"dragon king\" ( Chinese :  龙王 ) [18] [19]  and as the \"Sealed Lord of Vishaps\" ( Chinese :  被封印的岩龙之王  \"Sealed King of Geo Dragons.\" ) [20] [Note 2]  This is similar to the original Dragon of Water's description as a \"dragon-lord\" (along with the other original Seven Sovereigns) [3]  and an \"ancient lord of vishaps.\" [21] [Note 3]  However, the title of \"dragon king/lord\" is not exclusively used for the Seven Sovereigns, and too little is known about the Heavenly Principles's era or the world that came before it to determine Azhdaha's place among them.   The Seven Sovereigns are elemental dragons and are the purest embodiment of the elements. [1]  For this reason,  Dvalin   , an elemental dragon said to be born in the same manner as  slimes  and  crystalflies , [22]  and bearing the title \"Erstwhile King of the Skies\", may also be counted among their number. Additionally, Nahida likens the Dendro Sovereign Apep to Dvalin, [11]  and Dvalin, Azhdaha, Apep & Neuvillette are similarly grouped together elsewhere as notable dragons, but others such as  Scylla  are not. [23] [24] [25]   Xiuhcoatl   , the Flamelord, is theorized to be a Dragon Sovereign due to being referred  by a title most commonly shared with the Seven Sovereigns in  Natlan: Fiery Dragon , Dragon King (Chinese: 龙之王).  Pacal  makes direct reference to the Pyro Sovereign and their death in the same context of  Xbalanque 's reign, the most likely owner of this title being Xiuhcoatl as their death marked Xbalanque's ascension although with no explicit confirmation [26] .  The title of  龙王  \"Dragon King\"  is shared with  Beidou , likely in relation to her slaying of the sea monster  Haishan . This title is translated as \"Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean,\" or some variation thereof, in the English localization.   Notes [ ]     ↑   Neuvillette's Vision story states that \"all fragments of the primordial were driven to devour each other\" following the Gnoses' creation, which aligns with  Soraya 's line in the  World Quest   Treasure Lost, Treasure Found  about the Archon War starting when seven divine thrones — the Archons' seats — opened up in  Celestia .     ↑   In the Chinese version of \"Sealed Lord of Vishaps,\" \"Geo Dragons\" ( Chinese :  岩龙 ) is likely a truncated form of \"Geovishap\" ( Chinese :  岩龙蜥  \"Geo Dragon-Lizard\" ); alternatively, it refers to all Geo dragons, which encompasses but is not limited to Geovishaps.     ↑   In the Chinese version of  In the Light, Beneath the Shadow , the section equivalent to \"the Dragon of Water, the ancient lord of vishaps,\" is simply  水之元素龙王  \"Hydro Dragon King/Lord\"  and makes no direct reference to vishaps.

    "Vision": "Overview Gallery       Vision           Amber 's  Pyro vision       Type   Lore       Visions  are jeweled amulets which allow their users to directly channel the power of one of the seven  Elements . They are bestowed by  Celestia  and the  Seven Archons  to  allogenes , people of  Teyvat  with particularly powerful desires [1]  who have the potential to ascend to  Celestia  and become  gods  themselves. [2] [Note 1]   Allogenes who accomplish their goals will cause the gods to receive an \"abundant\" gift. [3]  On the other hand, evidence suggests that a person  deprived  of their Vision also loses that ambition, which may cause them to undergo a massive change in personality. [4]   In the upper left corner of the character menu is an  icon  that represents a playable character's Vision or equivalent, with their element denoted by the gem and their in-game nation denoted by the  decorative design  around the gem. This icon is present even for the characters that do not use Visions and characters with non-standard Vision designs.

This new order was created to suppress the world's original order in place of the  Heavenly Principles 's absolute authority, which it could no longer maintain after being gravely injured during the \"great war of vengeance.\" [3]  It and another unidentified entity created the seven  Gnoses  out of the remains of the Third  Descender , [5]  then instigated the  Archon War . [Note 2]  Once The Seven were established, they were given the stolen portions of elemental Authorities, which the Heavenly Principles took from the  Seven Sovereigns  when it first descended on Teyvat. [6]  The Seven were also given the duty of giving a Vision — a fragment of their power — as a \"gift\" to anyone whose powerful desire or ambition \"stepped into the threshold of the sacred.\" [3]   Vision-bearers' destinies are mapped by their  constellations , [7]  and the stars which form these constellations are called  Stella Fortuna . In abnormal circumstances, a person's constellation can affect the world thousands of years after their death. [8]  There are suggestions that these so-called \"destinies\" may be intentionally designed: the gods supposedly gain something when Vision-bearers successfully fulfill their goals, [3]  while statements by certain  Fatui Harbingers  claim that  \"the skies of Teyvat are fake\" [9]  and that \"the stars are a lie.\" [10]  Similarly, the  Narzissenkreuz Ordo  believed that obtaining a Vision is to \"sell oneself to the 'fate' of this world — to Heimarmene.\" [11] [Note 3]     Uses [ ]   While a Vision allows its user to harness its respective element, it does not grant instant mastery over elemental energy, [12]  and using elemental energy takes practice. [13]  As a result, there is a great variety in the ways people express their elemental powers, as well as a wide gulf in combat ability. For example,  Shenhe  combines her Cryo Vision, training in the  adeptus arts , and innate destructive power to freeze an entire tsunami, [14]  but  Yaoyao , another  adeptus  disciple, has only been shown to channel her  Dendro  powers through the external device Yuegui.  Vision-bearers can channel elemental energy through otherwise mundane objects, like  Charlotte  does with Monsieur Verite, a custom-made  Kamera  gifted by her father. [15]  When  Fischl  obtained her Vision, she subconsciously manifested  Oz , [16]  whose appearance is based on a character in her favorite novel series,  Flowers for Princess Fischl . [17]   In cutscenes and other official media, characters have demonstrated more uses for their Visions than gameplay allows.  Ningguang  can teleport and summon the  Guizhong Ballistae  replicas built into the  Jade Chamber  using Geo energy, [18]  and  Mona  can teleport herself and those she touches using her  Hydro  Vision. [19]  When  Tartaglia  uses his Hydro Vision during  Enter the Golden House  Phase 1, he has several abilities not utilized by his playable version, such as generating a Hydro Shield and summoning a massive Hydro whale. In the  manga ,  Jean  and  Amber  simultaneously infuse Jean's sword with  Anemo  and  Pyro  while defeating the  Ruin Hunter -ified  Krupp ,  Kaeya  creates ice barriers, and Amber summons a Pyro shield to protect herself and  Collei  from  Barnabas .  Those with Visions have some level of elemental sensitivity and  Elemental Sight , although some characters are more sensitive to the elements than others. [20] [21]  Visions themselves can also resonate with other sources of elemental energy, which causes them to glow. [22] [23]  In the manga, Jean's Vision suddenly begins reacting with something, causing dandelion seeds to emerge from her Vision, [24]  but this phenomenon is never acknowledged again.  Vision holders are also capable of breathing underwater in the waters of  Fontaine . [25] [26]     In Gameplay [ ]   Further information:  Talents   In-game, a character's combat abilities are based on their  Talents , and are additionally affected by their  weapon  type,  ascension phase , and Constellation level. All playable characters have 2–4 active abilities which utilize elemental energy; all damage-dealing  Elemental Skills  and  Elemental Bursts  deal elemental damage, and some characters have the ability to take on the form of their element while they sprint (such as  Mona  and  Ayaka ).  Bow  users' fully charged  Aimed Shots  and all  Catalyst  users'  Normal Attacks  are infused with their element. Some attacks that normally deal  Physical DMG  can deal elemental damage instead if an  Elemental Infusion  or  conversion  occurs.  In certain quests, Visions serve as visual indicators to determine the player's proximity to a source of elemental energy. The closer the active character is to the target, the quicker their Vision will flash with the color of the item it is resonating with (blue for meteorite shards, yellow for  Starsplinter Iron ). [22] [23]  Furthermore, this effect only occurs with genuine Visions; characters without Visions (such as the  Traveler  and the  Raiden Shogun ) have no visual indicator, while  Venti  and  Zhongli 's fake Visions have no reaction.            Noelle's Vision giving off a Geo symbol-shaped glow.       Visions are also related to the following special gameplay effects, with equivalent effects (or lack thereof) for character models without Visions noted in sub-bullets:    When switching to a character with 100%  Energy , their Vision will briefly give off an elemental symbol-shaped glow, and a specific sound effect corresponding to the character's element will play.  Element symbols glow over the  Traveler 's chest plate, the leaf in  Nahida 's hair, and over the phoenix's eye on  Diluc 's chest when wearing the  Red Dead of Night  outfit.   The  Raiden Shogun  and  Neuvillette  do not have an elemental symbol glow.   While a character's Elemental Burst is ready, the gem's color also pulses. Some characters, such as Diluc,  Jean ,  Keqing ,  Alhaitham , and  Dori , also have additional gems or ornaments on their person that seem ordinary, but also pulse with the respective color when their Elemental Bursts are ready. These gems usually, but do not always, match the color of the character's element.  Traveler's chest plate, Raiden Shogun's items with the Electro mitsudomoe, and various parts of Nahida's outfit will pulse.   Neuvillette and Diluc in his Red Dead of Night outfit have no areas with pulsing colors.   When a character receives  Energy , their Visions will light up. Elemental particles and orbs fly directly into the Vision, or whichever object gives off the elemental symbol.‍ [ which of the three Electro symbol items for Raiden? ]   In Neuvillette's case, elemental particles and orbs fly to the center of his model.   Characters who have an  Arkhe  alignment will have a Pneuma- or Ousia-colored glow on their Vision or equivalent, such as the Traveler's chest plate, when the corresponding attack's cooldown is finished. In Neuvillette's case, the gem on his collar glows.   Some characters momentarily go invisible as part of their attacks, such as  Keqing ,  Lisa ,  Hu Tao , and  Rosaria . These may be abilities that use their Visions, as these characters visually disappear and reappear with a flash of their element.    Visions in Teyvat [ ]   Distributing Visions [ ]   Visions are given as a form of acknowledgement by Celestia, [27]  but contrary to popular Teyvat belief, the Archons do not have direct control over the distribution of Visions. Giving away a shard of their Authority is part of their duty, and they do not know who receives the Vision or what the person's desire is. [3]   Visions are obtained from whomever holds the elemental Authority, and this person does not need to be one of The Seven. After the current Hydro Sovereign,  Neuvillette , regains his full Hydro Authority, he willingly sets aside a portion of his power for humans to claim. [3]  Meanwhile, no new Electro Visions appeared for a year before the Traveler ventures to  Inazuma , beginning with the enactment of the  Vision Hunt Decree , ostensibly due to the Electro Archon's will. [21]  However, the current Electro Archon,  Ei , had already sequestered herself away in the  Plane of Euthymia  for approximately 400 years by that point, [Note 4]  and Ei herself is surprised to learn of this phenomenon from the Traveler. [28]     Obtaining Visions [ ]   Visions have been received in many different situations, ranging from near-death experiences and fights for survival [29]  to a person's otherwise mundane day. [30]  There is no known surefire way to receive a Vision or to reawaken a  Masterless Vision ; experience has shown that a desire to survive a close brush with death is not enough to grant a Vision on its own. [31] [32]   When a person becomes worthy of a Vision, they either receive a new Vision or reactivate a nearby Masterless Vision. The appearance of a new Vision generally falls into one of the following situations (characters not found in any of the following lists do not have enough information to categorize them):    Directly before or on a conscious recipient:  During a moment of crisis and/or violent conflict [Note 5]   During a moment of resolution or revelation [Note 6]   After a major (personal) accomplishment [Note 7]   While the recipient is conscious, typically after making a resolution or demonstrating their ambition, but appears:  Somewhere close by, and circumstances cause them to notice it [Note 8]   Among their personal items and is discovered later [Note 9]   In the recipient's presence while they are asleep or otherwise unconscious:  During or shortly after a crisis, and its appearance is associated with the resolution of the crisis [Note 10]   Unrelated to any immediate crisis [Note 11]   Non-human beings such as  Xiao ,  Yae Miko ,  Kirara ,  Xianyun , and  Sigewinne  can receive Visions, although the narrative questions whether their Visions are the same as humans'. [27]  According to Xiao's  Developer Insight , and later reiterated in Xianyun's Vision Story, adepti can manipulate the elements without an external Vision, but Xiao and Xianyun wear Visions to \"comply with the expected norm.\" [33]  Artificial humans and puppets like  Albedo  and the  Wanderer  are also capable of receiving Visions.  The  Traveler 's  Vision story  claims they cannot receive one since they are an outsider to Teyvat, but Yae speculates they simply have not had a strong enough desire to receive one, telling them that their \"ambition should be something that transcends the world below and the starry sky above. Something that shines in unison with fate itself.\" [34]   Visions are received at various ages. Most humans receive their Visions between childhood and early adulthood, as children hope for Visions once they \"grow up\" [35]  and adults may eventually conclude that they will never receive a Vision. [36] [37]  The few confirmed ages that have been given support the idea that those who obtain Visions typically get them young:        Character   Age (Years)      Shenhe   6 [29] [38]       Diluc   10 [39]       Hu Tao   13 [40]       Fischl   14 [41]       Other notable age benchmarks include:    Kaveh , who had been a graduate of the  Sumeru Akademiya  for some number of years when he received his Vision, acquired it after raising funds to build the second version of  The Palace of Alcazarzaray . [32]  Given that Kaveh is implied to currently be in his late twenties, he likely received his Vision in his mid-twenties, depending on how long it took for the Palace of Alcazarzaray to go through its initial planning stages and be built to 70% completion the first time.   Ganyu , a half-adeptus, received her Vision after the  Archon War  ended 2,000 years ago. [42]  While her exact age is unknown, she was acquainted with  Guizhong , [43]  who died during the destruction of  Guili Plains  3,700 years ago. [43] [Note 12]   There are no known cases of people with more than one Vision permanently active.  Kaedehara Kazuha  once temporarily reactivated a Masterless Vision and used it alongside his own Vision, when he resonated with his  late friend 's ambition to deflect the  Musou no Hitotachi , [44]  but this situation is extremely rare and, to most people's knowledge, considered to be impossible. [45]     Wearing Visions [ ]   Most known Vision users, aside from some  NPCs  and Diluc in his Red Dead of Night outfit, [46]  openly wear their Visions. Most Visions are hung on the waist or back, but some are attached to a personal belonging rather than an article of clothing. Several characters also had their Visions directly appear on their clothing when they first received it.  Visions do not have to be openly worn to channel their power, as Diluc uses his Pyro Vision in present-day while wearing Red Dead of Night. [47]  However, there seems to be some point after which a person can no longer connect to their Vision; to prevent his Vision from going out-of-control again, Tartaglia leaves his Vision to the Traveler, [48]  and the item description for  Childe's Vision  says it \"has lost its glow now that its owner has left it behind.\" This dulled appearance was also earlier seen with Visions taken from their owners and installed in the  Statue of the Omnipresent God  during Inazuma's  Vision Hunt Decree .  Oddly, during the  Archon Quest   A Flower Blooms in a Prison  in  Chapter II : Act I -  The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia , the story goes out of its way several times to highlight that  Yoimiya  is openly wearing her real Vision in the midst of the Vision Hunt Decree, and that she is at risk of having it taken away should it be discovered. Given that the quest was written almost a full year before Red Dead of Night was released, it may be that the development team had not yet decided whether Visions could be used without being openly worn.    Losing Visions [ ]   Based on  Keqing 's extensive research, Visions cannot be destroyed. [49]  However, they can still be separated from their owners either willingly or by force. A person separated from their Vision may quite literally lose the ambition or goal that previously drove them, and in some cases, even lose critical memories; on the other hand, some people who have lost their Visions displayed no negative consequences.  Tejima ,  Kurosawa Kyounosuke , and  Domon  all suffered from losing their Visions to the Vision Hunt Decree, but Tejima and Kurosawa Kyounosuke lost certain memories that defined their actions in the past, [50] [51]  while Domon instead hallucinated the people he defeated until he spoke with  Anzai , his former fellow disciple. [4]   Iwakura Mitsunari 's decision to surrender his Vision to the Shogun may be the reason why he forgot the secret blade technique he once inherited as Master of the  Iwakura Art . [52] [Note 13]   On the other hand, neither  Arataki Itto  nor  Kuki Shinobu  seemed to be affected much by the loss of their Visions. Itto, despite losing his Vision to  Kujou Sara  after a duel, remains as rowdy and lively as before, while Shinobu willingly gave hers up and did not see its loss as anything particularly concerning. [53]  Additionally, many people who lost their Visions to the Vision Hunt Decree did not grow depressed and instead joined the  Watatsumi Army  to fight back. [44] [54]   Meanwhile,  Nobumori , who surrendered his Vision to  Kamisato Ayato  for personal reasons, enjoys life without his Vision and says that the \"obsessions [he] had before all disappeared.\" [55]  Similarly,  Jiangxue , who already exacted the justice he sought, says that he is now \"free of desire.\" [56] [Note 14]   Those who regain a lost Vision also regain their previous ambitions or drive in general, [57]  although more muted than before in some cases. Tejima regains his memories of the girl he was waiting for [58]  and Kurosawa Kyounosuke regains his memories of his father's teachings and says he feels the \"embers of [his] past wishes start to burn again,\" [59]  while Domon feels that he has changed too much since losing his Vision to fulfill his dream, and leaves his former ambition to his disciples. [60]  People who have surrendered their Visions, even permanently, appear to still possess some level of elemental sensitivity. [61]   Diluc 's aspirations, which \"burned bright\" in his Vision, were \"extinguished\" after  Crepus ' death four years ago. He left  Mondstadt  and his Vision behind to investigate his father's death, [62]  instead using the  Delusion  that had killed Crepus [63]  to no apparent ill effect. He began using his Vision again after he returned to Mondstadt a few years later, his ambition restored. [62]   Visions separated from their owners have a duller appearance, but will retain their elemental powers and innate connections to their owners. When Vision-deprived members of the Watatsumi Army charged at the Raiden Shogun, their Visions in the Statue of the Omnipresent God lit up in response to their resolve, [64]  while the Traveler has dreams depicting Tartaglia's situation while in possession of  Childe's Vision . [65]     Masterless Visions [ ]           An unresonated Masterless Vision from Inazuma. Such Visions lack any elemental status and are unable to give specific elemental talents.       After allogenes die, their Visions deactivate, losing their color and becoming an empty husk without a trace of elemental power. [66] [67]  Such Visions are known as  Masterless Visions  and have a low probability of resonating with another person.  Based on Kazuha's temporary reawakening of his  late friend 's Vision, a Masterless Vision is reawakened when a person's desire is the same as the original owner's, and will take on the same element as before. After Kazuha blocked the  Raiden Shogun 's  Musou no Hitotachi , his friend's Vision returned to its deactivated state. [44]  He is currently the first and only character to have had two active Visions at any given moment, and this unheard-of phenomenon led some witnesses to assume he was using a Delusion. [45]   Due to the rarity and special properties of Visions, Masterless Visions are seen as a commodity. Ningguang believed there was a potential market in selling Masterless Visions to the wealthy who hoped to reawaken one, while Kazuha futilely attempted to see whether his friend's Vision could be reawakened during  the Crux Clash . [31]   Characters who have reawakened a Masterless Vision include:    Mona [68]   Ningguang [66]   Kaedehara Kazuha  (temporarily, and in addition to his own  Anemo  Vision) [44]     Counterfeit Visions [ ]   \"Counterfeit Visions\" and other similar terms can refer to two different things:    Items that look exactly like genuine Visions but cannot be used to wield the elements. [54]  These have been used by Vision bearers to deceive enforcers of the  Vision Hunt Decree , and by Venti and Zhongli to disguise their ability to wield elemental powers without a Vision.  Additionally, Venti has given his fake Vision the ability to transform into the \"Der Frühling\" lyre, [69]  which is the only case of a fake Vision having additional utility other than deception.   During the play  \"The Little Oceanid\" , a prop Vision was supposed to be lowered onto the stage for the character Clio. However, when  Furina  replaced the  actress  who was supposed to play Clio due to health issues, before Paimon could lower the prop, a genuine Hydro Vision appeared before Furina. [70]   Delusions , devices developed and propagated by the  Fatui  which allow wielders to manipulate the elements without, or in addition to, a Vision. [63]  Most mass-produced Delusions are designed to resemble Visions, which the Fatui used to their advantage to convince members of the Watatsumi Resistance to use them. [71]   As seen in the second phase of  Enter the Golden House , Tartaglia's Delusion can apparently \"take over\" his Vision orb when its powers are unleashed, replacing his Hydro Vision's color and symbol with the Electro element and a Fatui symbol. However, his Delusion is not tied to his Vision otherwise, and he uses it normally even after he gave his Vision to the Traveler. [72]   Appearance [ ]   See also:  Vision/Gallery   Visions come with a decorative casing, which depends on the nation the person was in when they received it. [73]  Visions can be  customized  with accessories, but whether the original casing can be modified is unknown. The only character with clearly nonstandard casing is  Kaeya , whose Vision casing has two wings on each side at the bottom instead of the standard three on other Mondstadt cases. Though, when wearing  Sailwind Shadow , his Vision appears as a standard Mondstadt Vision.  Visions from the same region all share the same basic shape. As such, the main difference in appearance between Visions other than the elemental color and surrounding decorative design are usually personal touches added by the owner. For example,  Venti  has fluffy balls and feathers on strings hanging from his Vision, and he also has a large decorative wing affixed directly to the Vision gem on the left side of the Vision when facing the front of it.  Visions appear to vary in size; for example,  Ganyu 's Cryo Vision and  Diluc 's Pyro Vision appear very small, while  Yanfei 's Pyro Vision,  Jean 's Anemo Vision, and  Kaeya 's Cryo Vision are much larger. Oddly,  Barbara 's and  Lisa 's Visions differ in size while wearing their outfits  Summertime Sparkle  and  A Sobriquet Under Shade  compared to their default outfits, and  Xiao 's Vision is significantly larger in his portrait art than in his  Wish  art and on his in-game model.  Wriothesley 's Vision is said to have shrunk in size between the time he acquired it and the time he finally took it out to wear it, [74] [Note 15]  but as this is the only mention of a Vision's size in-universe and given the inconsistencies between Vision appearances for the same character in present day, no conclusions can currently be drawn about Vision sizes.  The Traveler, the Archons, and Neuvillette do not use Visions to resonate with an element, although they have visual indicators that glow in a similar manner as Visions. The star-shaped accents on the Traveler's clothing change to reflect their currently resonated element, while Venti and  Zhongli  wear  fake Visions  which behave like other characters' Visions in most gameplay. The  Raiden Shogun  wears three items bearing the Electro symbol on her clothing (one tied to her obi, one embedded on the pauldron on her left shoulder, and one affixed to a fan on her back), which glow faintly when her Elemental Burst is available. The leaf in  Nahida 's hair also has a similar effect.    Mondstadt [ ]           Mondstadt's basic Vision shape Note:  Uses  Venti 's Vision.       The typical  Mondstadt  Vision is orb-shaped, inlaid in a thin border adorned by a pair of tri-feathered wings, with a diamond-shaped tail on the bottom and five spikes at the top. On its back there may or may not be three wing-like decorations along the bottom on one side.    Nonstandard Vision designs     Kaeya 's Vision has two feathers on each wing instead of the usual three.  Kaeya's Vision in his  Sailwind Shadow  outfit has the usual three feathers on each wing.   Venti's \"Vision\" is an ordinary glass orb he uses to help hide his identity. [2] [69]  It does not glow when in proximity to  Starsplinter Iron .   Lisa 's Vision is slightly oval-shaped and elongated instead of the usual orb-shaped.     Liyue [ ]             Liyue's basic Vision shape. Note:  Uses  Zhongli 's Vision.       The typical  Liyue  Vision is square-shaped rotated at a 45-degree angle, inlaid in a thin border, and its corners have arrow accents on the front and smaller squares on the back. The border itself is in another square-shaped border with its corners cut, offset by 45 degrees.    Nonstandard Vision designs     Xiao  and Xianyun's Visions may not be typical Visions, as both of them are adepti and wear a Vision specifically because they take on a human form. [75]   Xingqiu 's and  Yaoyao 's Vision on their character models have the back side facing outward instead of inward. Xingqiu's card art is depicted with the front side of his Vision facing outward, as expected of a Liyue Vision in general.   Zhongli's \"Vision\" is likely not a real Vision, for reasons similar to Venti. It also does not glow when in proximity to Starsplinter Iron.     Inazuma [ ]             Inazuma's basic Vision shape. Note:  Uses  Yae Miko 's Vision.       The typical  Inazuma  Vision is orb-shaped, inlaid in a thin border surrounded by a full-circle stylized bow with a stylized knot at the bottom and three solid circles along the top half of the circle, with the middle circle being the biggest of the three.  The design seems to be inspired by the real-life  Japanese thunder deity Raijin . The three solid circles spanning the top semicircle may symbolize the Taiko thunder drum scaffold surrounding Raijin, and the bow may be derived from the Celestial Cloth around his shoulders.      Sumeru [ ]             Sumeru's basic Vision shape. Note:  Uses  Tighnari 's Vision.       The typical  Sumeru  Vision is orb-shaped, inlaid in a teardrop- or leaf-shaped border pointed at the top. At the bottom, the border has two points at the side pointing upwards and three points in the middle pointing downwards.    Nonstandard Vision designs     Rana 's Vision on her character model has the back side facing outward instead of inward. This is also reflected in her  Genius Invokation TCG   Support Card .     Fontaine [ ]   Fontaine's basic Pneuma aligned Vision shape. Note:  Uses  Charlotte 's Vision, adapted to Hydro for demonstration purposes Fontaine's basic Ousia aligned Vision shape. Note:  Uses  Sigewinne 's Vision.   The typical  Fontaine  Vision is orb-shaped, inlaid in a thin border shaped like two ribbons with ornamental clamshell designs on the sides.  Arkhe  alignment is a trait unique to Fontainians and is reflected in their Vision designs. There are two standard designs, one for each alignment:    Pneuma -aligned characters possess Visions whose border extends into two criss-crossing ribbons around a spike on top and bottom, with its clamshell ornaments pointing upwards on the left and downwards on the right.   Ousia -aligned characters possess Visions whose border extends into a spiral on top and bottom, with its clamshell ornaments pointing downwards on the left and upwards on the right.     Nonstandard Vision designs               Furina 's unique Vision.       Furina 's Vision, befitting her ability to switch Arkhe alignments, borrows elements from both Pneuma- and Ousia-aligned Visions. It is set in a frame that has clamshell ornaments pointing downwards on the left and upwards on the right (representing  Ousia ) and an elongated spike on the bottom (representing  Pneuma ), with four prongs holding the gem in place.     Natlan [ ]             Natlan's basic Vision shape (note: uses  Kachina 's Vision)       The typical  Natlan  Vision is orb-shaped, inlaid in a thin border shaped as a saltire with insignia resembling spiral  greca  patterns [76]  common in Mesoamerican culture, such as in  xicalcoliuhqui  motifs. A spike adorns the in-between of the saltire points, resembling a  primogem  star.  This overall shape resembles the  Ōlīn  motif depicted in Aztec art, such as the  Aztec calendar stone .    Nonstandard Vision designs               Ororon's silver Vision     Ororon 's Vision has a silver decorative design, similar to a Snezhnayan Vision, in contrast to the golden or polished bronze color found on all known Visions from Natlan.     Snezhnaya [ ]             Snezhnaya's Vision shape (with Fatui insignia). Note:  Uses  Tartaglia 's Vision but adapted to Cryo for demonstration purposes.                 Snezhnaya's Vision shape (without Fatui insignia). Note:  Uses Tartaglia's Vision but adapted to Cryo for demonstration purposes.       The typical  Snezhnaya  Vision is orb-shaped, surrounded by angled protrusions jutting out the top, bottom, left, and right sides, roughly reminiscent of a military badge.  Delusions  found in-game look the same as Snezhnayan Visions, with the exception of the elemental symbol on the orb being replaced by the Fatui emblem.  So far, for unknown reasons, all Visions and Delusions from Snezhnaya have a gray decorative design (possibly aluminum or iron), in contrast to the golden or polished bronze color found on all known Visions from the other nations.    Nonstandard Vision designs     Tartaglia 's  Vision  on his character model has the  Hydro  symbol rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from its initial position so that it is displayed upright, due to wearing his Vision sideways.     Other Vision Designs [ ]             Aloy's Vision.       Aloy , who does not belong to any of the seven nations, has a unique Vision design. Her Vision takes the form of a primogem star with round edges inlaid in a golden circular frame. In all gameplay, Aloy's Vision behaves normally. It is unknown if this Vision design canonically exists in the world of Teyvat, or if it is for collaboration purposes only.      Customized Visions [ ]   See also:  Vision/Gallery § Visions by Character   Some Visions also have customized decorations on them:    Amber 's Vision has two red ribbons with flame patterns and two white-yellow diamonds at the bottom.

Kaeya 's Vision in his  Sailwind Shadow  outfit is mounted on a star-shaped plate with two golden teardrops dangling from his Vision.   Kamisato Ayaka 's Vision is attached at the back of the royal blue ribbon in her dress tied with a bright pink cloverleaf knot.   Kamisato Ayato 's Vision has an upside-down fan with a bundle of thread hanging from the bottom.   Keqing 's Vision has a bundle of lilac thread hanging from the bottom. While in her  Opulent Splendor  outfit, the lilac thread is replaced with a violet feather.

Yaoyao 's Vision is attached to the red ribbon woven on the back of her basket.   Yelan 's Vision has a light blue rope hanging at the bottom.   Impressions on Visions [ ]   Despite presumably existing for the past 2,000 years since the Archon War ended, Visions remain an enigma to the people of Teyvat and very little headway has been made into Vision research. Allogenes are generally seen as \"the chosen\" [77]  or otherwise having favor from the gods. Playable characters have \"About the Vision\"  Voice-Over  lines, which give their impressions about Visions; many human characters' reflect their attitudes about receiving Visions or how Visions are useful to them.  Because the actual method for Vision distribution is a closely-guarded secret, people have developed different beliefs on which Archon granted them their Visions. Some attribute their Visions to their nation's Archon even if the elements do not match, [78]  others believe it was given by their element's Archon even if they are from a different nation, [79]  and still others refer to their Visions as something granted by the gods or Archons in general. [80]   Because Vision-bearers are matched to constellations, they are said to each have the power of a tiny cosmos in themselves.  Liyue 's  thaumaturges  call this \"The Microcosmic Orbit\" or the \"Microcosmos.\" [81]  This belief may be supported by the appearance of Ningguang's constellation,  Opus Aequilibrium , behind her when she invoked all her  Geo  power in the joint attack against  Beisht .  Some of those who never receive a Vision feel that they have been ignored and unrecognized by the Archons despite their achievements, unaware that The Seven actually have no involvement in the matter.  Wang  questions how the  Millelith  of 500 years ago remained loyal to  Rex Lapis  when he didn't give them Visions, even in their final moments, [82]  and  Dr. Edith  likens living without a Vision to living \"like outsiders in their own world.\" [83]   When Electro Visions stopped appearing after the Raiden Shogun enacted the Vision Hunt Decree, scholars at  Sumeru Akademiya  investigated and concluded that the Archons' wills determine the distribution of new Visions. [21]  Similarly, Kazuha postulates that each of the Seven Archons have their criteria for granting Visions and that the Raiden Shogun's doubts about Visions have resulted in a lack of new Electro Visions. [36]  However,  Ei  herself is surprised to learn of this phenomenon, [28]  leaving the true reason unknown.    Non-Playable Vision Users [ ]   Aside from a few notable exceptions, most  playable  and  upcoming  characters use Visions or are most likely using Visions. Other known characters who have, or had, Visions include:    Citlali  ( Cryo )   Iansan  ( Electro )   Atea  ( Pyro )   Domon   Fujiki  ( Cryo ),  Fukami  ( Electro ), and (Unnamed) ( Anemo ) (500 years ago) [84]   Hanshirou   Ingbert  ( Pyro ) [77]  (1,000 years ago)   Iwakura Mitsunari  (formerly, surrendered it during the  Vision Hunt Decree ; slain during  Iwakura Art's Downfall )   Jiangxue  (formerly, gave his Vision up)   Kazuha's friend  ( Electro ) (killed during the Vision Hunt Decree)   Kurosawa Kyounosuke   Liliuo  ( Cryo )   Nobumori  (formerly, surrendered it to Kamisato Ayato after losing a duel)   Rana  ( Dendro )   Tejima   Various members of the  Watatsumi Army  (all elements)   The Millelith soldier who set up  a memorial with \"treasure\"  in  The Chasm  (500 years ago)   The disciple who set up the  Mt. Aocang Ruins Treasure monuments   Possible Vision Users [ ]   Leonard [8]  (2,000 years ago) [85]  — He is not depicted with a Vision, but he had a constellation and his powerful desire to climb  Pilos Peak  caused the events of  Unreconciled Stars .   Primordial Albedo  ( Geo ) — Primordial Albedo is depicted with a Vision as part of his disguise, however, whether he has any actual Geo-manipulating ability is unknown.   Vennessa  — While she has never been mentioned or depicted with a Vision, legends claim she ascended to Celestia and the manga depicts her ascension as part of Venti's tale. While all Vision wielders are allogenes, whether all allogenes are Vision wielders has not been addressed.   Trivia [ ]   Vision bearers can use  Portable Waypoints . [86]   Monroe  mentions a \"God's Eye\" in one of his voiced idle lines, which is the direct translation of the Chinese term for Visions.   A nation's Vision shape can be seen on  Character Cards , as the topmost icon containing the character's element.   A \"helix-shaped divine ladder\" can allegedly be seen inside Visions, which are also witnessed by those who ascend to Celestia. [87]  Such a phenomenon has not yet been shown in-game.   In the manga, when Collei breaks out of the shield Amber surrounded her in as proof of her resolve to protect those she cares about, the Pyro symbol in Amber's Vision is replaced by a star-shaped symbol intertwined with a triangle. The symbol returns to normal shortly afterwards. [88]   Yanfei  once attempted to weigh the value of a Vision (likely her own) with her steelyard balance, an adepti treasure that can be used to \"measure the value of all things,\" but only gives an object's value at the time that  Mora  itself was created. No amount of Mora she added was heavy enough to balance the scales, but it finally balanced after she placed the heavy box of handwritten legal notations from her waist on the scales in her frustration. [89] [Note 16]   From  Version 1.1  to  1.4 , the elemental symbol on Zhongli's Vision was rotated. However, this was a mistake and was fixed in  Version 1.5 , dispelling the then-common theory that he had unintentionally created his fake Vision with its elemental symbol in an incorrect configuration.   Etymology [ ]   The Chinese term for Vision,  神之眼   Shén zhī Yǎn , \"Eye of God,\"  is similar to the term for Gnosis,  神之心   Shén zhī Xīn , \"Heart of God.\"  Both of them are called  魔力器官  \"magical organs,\"  which was translated as \"magical foci\" in English.   In Gnosticism,  Allogenes  is a half-human, half-divine (or demigod) figure who, in some stories, becomes fully divine.  The Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese term for allogene is  原神 , which is also the game's title. It translates to \"primordial god\", \"original god\", or \"proto-god\".   Notes [ ]     ↑   Lost in translation is the fact that \"allogenes\" ( Chinese :  原神   Yuánshén ;  Japanese :  原神   Genshin ) is the same term as the game's title and means \"Primordial God.\"     ↑   Neuvillette's Vision story states that \"all fragments of the primordial were driven to devour each other\" after the creation of the seven Gnoses. This aligns with  Soraya 's exposition in the  World Quest   Treasure Lost, Treasure Found  that the Archon War was a \"protracted war [...] between the gods, each of whom coveted a seat at one of the seven divine thrones in Celestia.\"     ↑   Heimarmene 's name is derived from the Greek goddess of fate and destiny, particularly of cause and effect.     ↑   The  Archon Quest   A Dance of Destruction  in  Interlude Chapter : Act III -  Inversion of Genesis  states that the  Tatarasuna Mystery  occurred 400 years ago, while  Wanderer 's  Character Story 2  states that it was right around this time that Ei completed the Shogun and locked herself in the Plane of Euthymia.     ↑   Characters whose Visions appeared before them during a moment of crisis or conflict (in alphabetical order): Collei ,  Diona ,  Freminet ,  Kaeya ,  Kujou Sara ,  Lynette ,  Lyney ,  Mika ,  Razor ,  Rosaria ,  Sayu ,  Shenhe ,  Wanderer     ↑   Characters whose Visions appeared before them during a moment of resolution or revelation: Amber ,  Baizhu ,  Candace ,  Chevreuse ,  Cyno ,  Fischl ,  Furina ,  Kirara ,  Lisa ,  Nilou ,  Rana ,  Thoma ,  Qiqi     ↑   Characters whose Visions appeared before them after a major accomplishment: Beidou ,  Kamisato Ayaka     ↑   Characters whose Visions appeared at a nearby location which caused them to notice it: Albedo ,  Charlotte ,  Kamisato Ayato ,  Kaveh ,  Klee ,  Sucrose ,  Tighnari ,  Yoimiya     ↑   Characters whose Visions appeared among their personal items and were discovered while rummaging through them: Hu Tao ,  Kuki Shinobu ,  Layla ,  Navia ,  Wriothesley ,  Yun Jin     ↑   Characters whose Visions appeared while they were unconscious, during or after a crisis: Barbara ,  Bennett ,  Faruzan     ↑   Characters whose Visions appeared while they were peacefully asleep: Arataki Itto ,  Kaedehara Kazuha     ↑   Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go  indicates that  Liyue Harbor  was established shortly after the fall of Guili Plains.  Custodian of Clouds  and  The Fond Farewell  places the founding of Liyue Harbor at 3,700 years ago.     ↑   The description for  Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma  — the Iwakura Clan's heirloom sword last owned by Iwakura Mitsunari — states that none of the  Iwakura Clan  heads have obtained a Vision. It is unclear whether the contradicting lore is a developer oversight or an intentional decision.     ↑   This justice is assumed to be the reason Jiangxue received a Vision, due to the other narratives around giving up or losing a Vision, as well as the emphasis placed on how Jiangxue is now at peace and no longer feels the need to use his Vision.     ↑   As Wriothesley was already a teenager when he was convicted, the perceived difference in his Vision's size is unlikely to be caused by his own growth.     ↑   It is not stated whether she added the box along with the Mora, or if she replaced the Mora with the box.

Dandelion Wine is so famed that merchants and businesses from other nations have tried to gain understanding, both honestly and dishonestly, about Dawn Winery's methods and the Dandelion Wine brewing process, sometimes in hopes of directly imitating it. [1] [2]   According to the wine maker at the Dawn Winery,  Connor , it has a sweetish and refreshing taste, and it is rich in cereal aroma.  In high-class society, Dandelion Wine is to be poured into a silver goblet, \"allowed to breathe for 12 minutes\" (which likely means to let the goblet of wine sit in an open area undisturbed), and then have ice cubes added such that 60% of the ice is submerged beneath the wine. [3]   Thousand-Wind Wine is considered to be the first Dandelion Wine.

    "Thousand_Winds": "Thousand Winds     Type   Lore Factions       The  Thousand Winds  is a term that has appeared in legends and historical texts of  Mondstadt  and  Enkanomiya . It has been used to refer to the following:    Istaroth , the God of Time, also known as \"the thousand winds of time\" or simply \"the thousand winds.\" [1]   Personifications of the winds that protect Mondstadt, including  Barbatos  ( Venti ).

In Enkanomiya beliefs, Istaroth is the personification of \"undying wind\" and the phrases \"the thousand winds of time\" and \"the thousand winds\" refer to her and the power of wind. [1]   In Mondstadt, where worship of Istaroth seems to have faded out and been forgotten, \"the thousand winds\" is currently interpreted as the literal winds and clouds in northern  Teyvat , each of which were allegedly given names and personalities through the Cloud Atlas and serve as Mondstadt's protectors. [2] [5]   Venti  was originally a \"single thread of the thousand winds\" before he amassed power and eventually rose to godhood and the position of Archon as  Barbatos . [3]  Venti's power over wind is referred to, both by himself and by various descriptions in the game, as calling on the power of the thousand winds. [2] [6] [7]   The  Thousand Winds Temple , on the other hand, preserved some of the worship of the \"god of Time\"; the carvings on the sundials at the  Thousand Winds Temple  and the  Nameless Island  leave messages associated with both the god of Time and the god of Anemo:    \"Seeds of stories, brought by the wind and cultivated by time.\" Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time.\"   This can also be confirmed with the  Ragged Notebook  written by the missing friend of  Henry Morton , and the weapons in the  Sacrificial Series :    On the cliff facing the eastern sea, the ancestors worshipped the masters of Time and Anemo together. The two are intimately related, as expressed in the saying, \"Anemo brings stories while Time nurtures them.\" —Opening lines of the lore in  Sacrificial Bow ,  Sacrificial Greatsword  and  Sacrificial Sword Rituals took the form of performances, [...] A group who could bear the cold no longer built a shrine high on a clifftop in the east. — Sacrificial Fragments'  lore   Other Known Members [ ]   The nameless wind spirit that aided the  Gunnhildrs  when they were outside of  Decarabian 's city [8]   A wind spirit that took the form of a fox and accidentally created the first wine of Mondstadt.

    "Exorcist": "Exorcist     Type   Lore       Region   Liyue       Exorcists , also known as  thaumaturges , are people in  Liyue  who have sworn an oath to cleanse the land by hunting down  ghosts , spirits and demons. They are highly adept in combat, magic, and martial arts. [1]  Most exorcists are raised in families which practice the art as the family trade, although so far only one such group has been named: the Tianheng Thaumaturges.    Contents     1   Overview   2   Known Exorcist Clans     2.1   Tianheng Thaumaturges     2.1.1   Known Members       2.2   Yelan's Clan     2.2.1   Known Members           3   Notes   4   Change History   5   References   6   Navigation       Overview [ ]   Little is known about the origins of Liyue thaumaturgy, although it developed into its modern form 500 years ago, after the destruction wrought by the  cataclysm  led to a revolution in weaponsmithing and catalyst production. During this time, a shift was made which favored supernatural arts over traditional  martial arts , [2]  although thaumaturges continue to practice both.  Some thaumaturges in history have had close relations with the  adepti .  Sea Gazer  in particular is known to have been friends with a thaumaturge, to whom he gifted the  Fantastic Compass . [3]  It later fell into the hands of  Yelan 's ancestors, [4]  who may have researched it as the basis for the catalysts which can only be operated by members of her clan. [5]   Chongyun  also acknowledges  Shenhe  — who was trained in the adepti arts and not mortal thaumaturgy — as a master exorcist, which suggests that the supernatural arts practiced by exorcists may be derived from, or imitations of, adepti arts. [6]   So far, characters who have been seen utilizing exorcist arts in-game have all been  Vision -bearers, and it is unknown how exorcists without Visions perform supernatural arts. It seems that magic is not limited to Vision-bearers, [5]  but what exactly magic encompasses is left equally vague.    Known Exorcist Clans [ ]   Tianheng Thaumaturges [ ]   Heart be pure, evil be erased. Mind be purged, world be saved. —Mantra [7] [8]   The Tianheng Thaumaturges, an exorcism clan in Liyue, has a high number of exorcists within its ranks.  Chongyun 's family is from the clan, [9]  and his aunt,  Shenhe , was from a branch family. [10] [11]  Shenhe never learned any thaumaturgy from her parents, as her mother died when she was a child and her father went insane shortly after and attempted to sacrifice her to an evil spirit. [12]  However, her training in adepti arts has given her techniques similar to those used by exorcists, and Chongyun recognizes her as an adept exorcist. [6]  After it was openly learned that Shenhe was actually still alive, the clan elders were overjoyed. [13]   The clan keeps books passed down through the generations which record the evil spirits they have defeated. [14]  Despite his training as an exorcist, Chongyun has never personally met a spirit due to his abundance of yang energy, which banishes demons around him. [1]  However, he does not allow this to stop him on his way to becoming a master exorcist, though it does hinder the accuracy of the drawings in his clan's book. [14]   Chongyun and Shenhe's mother both used weapons to assist them in exorcism. Chongyun has a sword made of ice, [15]  and Shenhe's mother had a dagger that later ended up in Shenhe's possession. [16]   On  Chongyun's birthday , he performed prayer rituals with the elders of the clan on Mt. Tianheng. [9]     Known Members [ ]   Shenhe's father (deceased)   Shenhe's mother (deceased)   Chongyun   Shenhe  (possibly) [Note 1]   Yuandai 's husband   Yelan's Clan [ ]   At an unknown point in the past, Yelan's ancestors inherited the  Fantastic Compass , a device which can seal away evil creatures and was also previously owned by the adeptus  Sea Gazer  before he gave it to his thaumaturge friend. [3]  Using the Fantastic Compass as a basis, her clan developed several other catalysts, whose operating mechanisms are kept a secret within the clan. [5]   500 years ago, Yelan's ancestors  Boyang  and  Rongzhao  were exorcists who participated in the battle at  The Chasm  alongside the  Yaksha   Bosacius , and brought the Fantastic Compass with them. During the grueling campaign, the Millelith discovered a space which, for unknown reasons, had the power to suppress the Abyss. Boyang and several other Millelith decided to sacrifice themselves by luring the Abyssal monsters into this space — which Bosacius had already entered — and use the Fantastic Compass to seal them all within, with Rongzhao assisting with the sealing process from the outside. Rongzhao returned to Liyue without his brother, and rendered insane by exposure to Bosacius' karma.  Despite this, the clan has survived to the present, although it is unclear how much of their techniques are still practiced or if there are any members besides Yelan. Yelan possessed a family heirloom, a pair of bracelets engraved with a communication spell, but lost one of her bracelets while investigating one of  Pantalone 's secret trade routes. [17]  She continues to wear the remaining bracelet as an accessory and it glows when she uses her Vision.    Known Members [ ]   Boyang  (deceased)   Rongzhao  (deceased)   Yelan  (not practicing the family business)   Notes [ ]     ↑   Shenhe's in-game affiliation is not listed as the Tianheng Thaumaturges due to her alienation from human society; however, she seems to still practice, or at least know, thaumaturgy.

Lore [ ]   See also:  The Chasm's Bed § Lore   The Fantastic Compass is a magic device created by adeptus  Sea Gazer  used to seal away monsters. [1]  Later, Sea Gazer became good friends with a human and gave the device to him to use as a catalyst. A few years later, great demons began haunting the mountains and the mortal and the  adeptus  joined forces to exorcise them using this device. [2]   500 years ago,  Boyang  and  Rongzhao , two brothers who were ancestors of  Yelan , were gifted the Fantastic Compass by someone of great importance. [2]  Perhaps Yelan's clan studied the device because Yelan mentions that the compass is very similar to catalysts made by her clan that only they know how to use. [3]   When the  cataclysm  began, the two brothers were ordered by the  Qixing  to take the compass with them to aid the  Millelith  in the battle at  The Chasm  against the monsters of the Abyss. [4]  During the fight, they discovered  The Chasm's Bed  and lured the monsters deeper into the depths of the Chasm. Together,  Boyang  and  Bosacius  used the Fantastic Compass to seal the intersection between the Chasm's Bed and the rest of the Chasm, granting Liyue victory over the monsters with the compass being lost since then.  Much later on,  Yanfei  found a will in an old book. The writer of the will had wished to find the Fantastic Compass and wrote that they gave the magical device to  someone ambitious , hoping it'd be handy in times of need. According to Yanfei, an eye-witness account said the person who received it took it into The Chasm and the device has been missing since. This implies that the writer of the will is the one who gifted the Compass to Boyang. The book that the will was in describes the device: \"When mortal and adepti powers are combined, one can move the heavens and shake the earth. This contraption is proof that mortals and adepti may coexist, that there is unity between heaven and humanity.\" [2]   During  Perilous Trail , Yanfei, Yelan,  Arataki Itto ,  Kuki Shinobu , the  Traveler , and  Paimon  found themselves trapped in the Chasm's Bed. Although they wouldn't be able to find the original compass, the group devises a plan to use the  abilities of the Chasm's Bed  against it by imagining the compass so that the Chasm's Bed will conjur it. Yanfei then attempts to use the device to see if it works, since she has both adepti and human lineage; the device activated but only for a moment since Yanfei is not strong enough. The brief activation seemed to trigger something, causing the voices of Boyang and Bosacius to be heard from when they made the seal:      Media:vo cyaq005 2 together 01.ogg   Sound From Within the Compass:  By heaven's might and the gods of the five regions, yaksha and mortal together take this contraption in hand...     After Yanfei tested the device, Yelan and Xiao activated the device together to escape The Chasm's Bed. Because the compass they used was a conjuring of The Chasm's Bed and not the original, the group was unable to take it out with them when they escaped.

    "Karma": "Karma     Type   Lore       Region   Liyue       Karma , also referred to as  karmic debt  and  divine karma , is a term which refers to the corruptive forces left behind by the wills and powers of slain ancient  gods . This term is primarily used in  Liyue , where the  yakshas  were tasked with subduing the resurging might of fallen gods. [1]     Contents     1   Overview   2   Trivia     2.1   Etymology       3   Other Languages   4   Change History   5   See Also   6   References   7   Navigation       Overview [ ]   Over the course of the  Archon War ,  Morax  subdued many other ancient gods. Their powers and hatred seeped into the world, corrupting the land, spawning monsters, and creating pestilence. Contact with karma can induce insanity in humans [2]  and corrupt monsters, making them more powerful than normal.  Vision -bearers, [3]   illuminated beasts , [4]  and those with higher elemental sensitivity such as the  Traveler  have heightened resistance to the effects of karma.  To combat this, Morax summoned the yakshas to come to Liyue's defense by slaughtering the resurging powers of these fallen gods. Over time, however, karma seeped into the bodies and minds of the yakshas, causing them immense suffering. Many of those who did not fall in battle eventually succumbed to their karmic debt and went insane, many of them dying as a result of their insanity. [1]   Adepti  can use their form of  alchemy  to create a medicine called Remedium Tertiorum, which can temporarily alleviate the pain caused by karma. However, like most other adepti medicines, they are lethal to mortals. [5]     Trivia [ ]   Etymology [ ]   The English term refers to the principle of  karma , which can be loosely defined as the consequences of one's actions as it affects one's future, whether positively or negatively.   The original Chinese term,  业障   yèzhàng , specifically refers to karmic hindrance, or negative karmic consequences which hinder enlightenment.  Accordingly, Vision-bearers are less affected by karma and being in proximity to those deeply affected by karma; in the eyes of the adepti, Visions are a \"valid form of 'illumination'.\" [6]   Other Languages [ ]     Language Official Name Literal Meaning English Karma — Chinese (Simplified) 业障 Yèzhàng Karma Chinese (Traditional) 業障 Yèzhàng Japanese 業障 Goushou Karma Korean 업장 Eopjang Karma Spanish Karma — French Karma — Russian Карма Karma — Thai บาป Sin Vietnamese Nghiệp Chướng Karma German Karma — Indonesian Karma — Portuguese Carma Karma Turkish Karma — Italian Karma —   Change History [ ]   Introduced in  Version 1.0 [ Create New History ]   See Also [ ]   Abyssal Corruption   Tatarigami   References [ ]     ↑  1.0   1.1   Story Quest, Xiao, Alatus Chapter: Act I -  Butterfly's Dream , Part 2:  Glimmers of the Vigilant Yaksha  (Cinematic)     ↑   Yelan's Voice-Over:  About Xiao     ↑   Archon Quest, Interlude Chapter, Act II -  Perilous Trail , Part 5:  At Tunnel's End, Light     ↑   Archon Quest, Interlude Chapter, Act II -  Perilous Trail , Part 4:  End of the Line     ↑   Zhongli's Voice-Over:  About Xiao     ↑   Qiqi's Character Story:  Vision       Navigation [ ]     Lore     Terminology General   Abyssal Corruption   Archon   Delusion   Descender   Divine Nail   Dragon   Erosion   False Sky   Forbidden Knowledge   Four Shades   Ghost   Gnosis   God   Heavenly Principles   Hilichurls   Irminsul   Modifications   Ley Line   Martial Arts   Medicine   Mystic Arts   Realms   Light Realm   Void Realm   Realm of Consciousness   Seven Sovereigns   Symbols   Vision   Mondstadt   Dandelion Wine   Thousand Winds   Liyue   Dragonfall   Exorcist   Fantastic Compass   Historia Naturalis Liyue   Karma   Plaustrite   Rite of Parting   Seven Mountain Treatises   Solar Chariot   Sub-Space Creation   Zombie   Inazuma   Hyakkiyakou   Jade Steel   Jibashiri   Musou Isshin   Musou no Hitotachi   Plane of Euthymia   Shade of Tokoyo   Sunchildren   Tatarigami   The Five Kasen   Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri   Yougou Tengu   Sumeru   Akasha System   Anahitian Blessing   Diadem of Knowledge   Eleazar   Khvarena   Vasara Tree   Fontaine   Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale   Primordial Sea   Prophecy   Sinthe   Natlan   Ancient Name   Heroes of Natlan   Night Warden Wars   Ode of Resurrection   Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame   Sacred Flame   Turnfire   Wayob   Khaenri'ah   Art of Khemia   Azosite   Inteyvat   Ruin Golem   The Abyss   Foul Legacy Transformation   Other   Dodocommunication Device   Immernachtreich   Traveler's Original Sword         The World History   Archon War   Cataclysm   Mondstadt   Mondstadt Aristocracy   Liyue   Inazuma   Vision Hunt Decree   Sakoku Decree   Sumeru   Fontaine   Natlan   Snezhnaya   Khaenri'ah   Languages and Scripts   Teyvat Script   Latin-Based Language   Hilichurlian   Liyue Script   Inazuman Script   Sumeru Script   Deshret Script   Fontaine Script   Aranara Language   Culture   Hilichurls   Mondstadt   Liyue   Inazuma   Raiden Gokaden   Sumeru   Fontaine   Natlan   Snezhnaya   Khaenri'ah   Species   Aranara Bake-Danuki Dragon God Illuminated Beast Jinni Melusine Oceanid Pari Saurian Seelie Tighnarian Tri-Lakshana Creature Umibouzu Vishap Wayob Youkai Kitsune Oni Tengu   Entertainment   Akademiya Extravaganza   Hot Pot Game   Iridescence Tour   Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament   The Crux Clash         Historical Civilizations Mondstadt   Sal Vindagnyr   Decarabian's Mondstadt   Mondstadt Aristocracy   Liyue   Guili Assembly   Sal Terrae   Inazuma   Enkanomiya   Pre-Thunderbird Civilization   Thunderbird Civilization   Sumeru   Ay-Khanoum   Gurabad   Saleh   Tulaytullah   Fontaine   Remuria         Festivals Mondstadt   Ludi Harpastum   Weinlesefest   Windblume Festival   Liyue   Lantern Rite Festival   Moonchase Festival   Inazuma   Irodori Festival   Mikawa Flower Festival   Summer Festival   Sumeru   Akademiya Extravaganza   Sabzeruz Festival   Fontaine   Fontinalia Festival   Snezhnaya   Krsnik Noc         Media Story   Manga   Promotional Video   Story Teaser   Travail   A Winter Night's Lazzo   Version Trailer   Character   Character Demo   Character Detail   Character Introduction   Character Teaser   Collected Miscellany   Outfit Teaser   Other   A Journey of Art and Heritage   Birthday   Comics   Concept Art   Developer Insight   Developers Discussion   Extended Play   Long-Term Project   Gourmet Tour   Holiday Artwork   Paimon's Paintings   Scenery and Sentiment   Soundtrack   Special Program   Teyvat Food Notes   Teyvat Times   Video",

It does not float by default, requiring to be activated first. Before activation, it weighs approximately the same amount as other types of stone. [2]   The most common color of Plaustrite is green, but varieties of other colors exist. There is little difference between the properties of regular Plaustrite and other-colored Plaustrite; their names were simply given to them by gemstone merchants to impress customers, and as a result, their price is significantly higher compared to regular Plaustrite. [3]     Varieties of Plaustrite [ ]     \"Common\" Plaustrite     Azurite     Vermillionite   Sunset Vermillionite ( Chinese :  鸣霞浮生石 ) is a name given to particularly large chunks of Vermillionite.   Usage [ ]   This material has been used in various constructions and objects, mostly in  Liyue :    Plaustrite Platforms , small platforms found in various places around Liyue.  In the  Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula   Domain , blue Plaustrite Platforms are encountered. They are very similar to their normal counterparts but appear and disappear periodically.   Bu'yun 's platform to transport visitors from  Liyue Harbor  to the Jade Chamber is a specially carved Plaustrite Platform.   The foundation of  Minlin 's  Statue of The Seven .   The foundation of  Cloud Retainer 's  Dwelling in the Clouds , above  Qingyun Peak .   Large platforms in  Adepti  abodes.   Ningguang 's  Jade Chamber .  Specifically, it uses Sunset Vermillionite.

Moonchase Charms  of the  Moonchase Festival , carved from Plaustrite Shards.   Trivia [ ]   Obtaining a piece of Sunset Vermillionite is one of the main goals of the  Interlude Chapter  Act  The Crane Returns on the Wind .  Sunset Vermillionite is extremely rare and expensive to start with, and because of Ningguang's contest, its price inflated even more by the time the  Traveler  inquired to buy some. The  Feiyun Commerce Guild  was planning to auction one piece off, and according to  Xingqiu 's estimation, it could potentially go for over 500 million  Mora  given the current demand.   The  adeptus   Sea Gazer  had a piece of Sunset Vermillionite among their treasures.

It states that this substance springs forth from Stonemarrow within the mountains, and will bring disaster to any mere mortals who touch it. Sustained contact with Smaragdus Jadeite by someone without a  Vision  over a prolonged period will, in less serious cases, cause a mild malady, while in serious cases, the patient may suffer a dramatic change of personality and fall seriously ill. [1]   The Seven Mountain Treatises also records that  Tianqiu Valley  was once home to a mysterious kind of stone that would absorb the rosy hue of sunset after basking in it evening after evening over a long period, which became known as \" Sunset Stone .\" However, the claim has never been proven. Today, this term is used generally to refer to all manner of brown-colored stones.

[1]  In the distant past, while  Morax  was still young, the Solar Chariot fell to  Teyvat , creating  The Chasm .

According to  Records of Jueyun: Hidden Jade , the Solar Chariot was a star with a proud and agitated temper. While it slumbered after its fall to the earth, it reawakened during the  Archon War  and, unable to stand the bloodshed and warring that filled the earth, leapt back into the sky. [2]  In another story, the Solar Chariot was an object that was repaired by the indigenous people in The Chasm and then flew back into the sky.

Sub-Space Creation     Type   Lore       Region   Liyue       Sub-Space Creation  or  Waijing   ( Chinese :  外景   Wàijǐng , \"Outdoor Scene\" ) [1]  is an  adeptal  ability used to create small, autonomous pocket worlds through imagination. [1] [2]   This ability was a blessing from  Rex Lapis  and has been used during troubling times for some brief respite. [3]  Even though it is a powerful adeptal ability, it does have limitations: one cannot build a whole city inside, since it is not a true world. [4]     Contents     1   Capabilities   2   Trivia   3   Other Languages   4   Change History   5   References   6   Navigation       Capabilities [ ]   Sub-Space Creation imbues items with a particular energy, which can cause them to have special properties that are different from the world of Teyvat:    Soil has unlimited nutrition, and gardens will grow without intensive care. [5]   Fish ponds contain nutrients and have clear, warm water all year. [6]   Hot springs can maintain an optimal temperature for a long time. [7]   Paints with Sub-Space Creation energy are used to resonate with the Traveler and implant their memories on a canvas. [8]   Chubby  believes that Sub-Space Creation energy could allow severed lizards'  tails  to regrow into a new lizard, though this theory has not been tested. [9]   However, even Sub-Space Creation cannot be used to recreate the original form of  Padisarahs  that went extinct after the death of the  Goddess of Flowers . [10]   Beings that originated outside of the Serenitea Pot can benefit from Sub-Space Creation energy.  Onmyoudou , the art used to create the  Omni-Ubiquity Net , was created by  Kamuna Harunosuke , who was also familiar with adeptal arts. Thus, the Omni-Ubiquity Net's ability to recreate small creatures inside the Realm Within may be related to Sub-Space Creation. [11]     Trivia [ ]   Madame Ping  has used Sub-Space Creation for her  teapot .   Even though  Yanfei  is technically able to use Sub-Space Creation, she struggles with it and thus has not created one herself. [12]   Traveler  is able to use Sub-Space Creation. It is unclear how Traveler is able to use this adeptal ability, but it could be because the Adepti lent their power to the Traveler during the  battle against Osial .   Venti  has likely visited an abode created by Sub-Space Creation beforehand.

    "Zombie": "Zombie     Type   Lore       Region   Liyue       A  zombie  is an individual who has been resurrected from the dead.   Currently, two zombies are known:    Qiqi , who resurrected after being imbued with a large amount of  adeptal  energy.   Jialiang , who died from a heart condition and was brought back to life by  Baizhu  through the use of the Elixir of Immortality during  The Formula for a Miracle  in  Baizhu 's  Story Quest ,  Lagenaria Chapter : Act I -  The Heart of Healing .   Contents     1   Overview   2   Trivia   3   Other Languages   4   Change History   5   References   6   Navigation       Overview [ ]   Zombies are made when the corpse of a dead person is reanimated through medical or magical means. Their bodies are typically covered by talismans, which function to sustain their state of suspended animation.  Zombies normally take orders from the person who awakened them, who then becomes their master. However, this is not always the case. Qiqi, who was never awakened by anyone, woke up on her own after being dislodged from the amber that trapped her — and is thus her own master, operating by giving herself orders. [1] [2]  Similarly, Jialiang maintained his sentience after being awakened by Baizhu. This could mean that the person who awakened the zombie can choose to either control it or set it free.  Although they may appear to be a regular, living human at first glance, zombies have cold and stiff bodies due to the onset of  rigor mortis . As a result, they are usually forced to move around by hopping. Qiqi circumvents this by performing calisthenics on a daily basis, [3]  but reverts to her undead state in combat, which gives her inhuman strength. [4]  She also lost her sense of taste after becoming a zombie, [5]  but can still distinguish texture.  Due to her undead nature, Qiqi has an incredibly poor memory; she will forget a person within three days if she does not regularly reinforce her memories of them, and admits to forgetting Baizhu's face regularly. To commit important information to memory, she writes down important information in a notebook. [3]  She also speaks monotonously and displays few expressions. However, her wit is not as diminished as it may appear; she has long realized that Baizhu has underlying motives for taking her in, [6]  and learned how to hide from  Hu Tao  as to avoid being buried.  Uniquely, Jialiang maintained his memory and normal speech patterns even after being resurrected as a zombie. It is possible that this is due to the properties of the Elixir of Immortality, which does not involve the use of adeptus arts.    Trivia [ ]   Zombies in Liyue are specifically  jiangshi , a type of undead creature from Chinese folklore.  Qiqi's appearance is modelled after typical depictions of jiangshi; such as the style of her hat which resembles a Qing dynasty  Guanmao , and the paper  talisman  hanging off her forehead.

While it was in Makoto's possession, the blade was kept unsharpened and unused, and was used as a symbol of true peace. After her death during the  cataclysm  500 years ago, she left a faint fragment of her will in it [1]  and passed it on to her sister  Ei , who began to use it as a weapon in battle. [2]   After creating  the Shogun , Ei transferred her consciousness into the Musou Isshin and created the  Plane of Euthymia , while the sword itself is kept within the Shogun and summoned from her heart.  Ever since the Musou Isshin was passed down, Ei and the Shogun have performed the  Musou no Hitotachi  with this blade. After Ei had a change of heart and released the full power of the Musou Isshin, Makoto's will was released from it.

In the Chinese and Japanese descriptions for Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu, \"Musou no Hitotachi\" is written using the characters for \"dream\" rather than the ones for \"blank mind.\" The description points this out, saying that the Raiden Shogun has abandoned \"the void-like 'Musou,' [and] she now shoulders a new 'Musou' — the dreams and ambitions of all.\"   The Musou Isshin is a  tachi , a Japanese sword used by samurai, albeit with a slightly longer hilt and blade than the more famous katana.

A sword art without parallel in all the world. —Raiden Shogun's  Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion   When Ei uses the Musou no Hitotachi, she dashes behind her target and slices through a point in space with the  Musou Isshin , briefly freezing time. The target will be marked with the Electro symbol before being surrounded by six lightning bolts before time is unfrozen. Those lightning bolts then all simultaneously slash the target before engulfing them in a beam of lightning, killing them instantly.  When Ei used Musou no Hitotachi on  Orobashi  and  Akuou  during the Watatsumi Island insurrection, the resulting slash split  Yashiori Island  in half and created  Musoujin Gorge . The Shogun also used this technique to punish those who lose a duel before the throne, with two known victims being  Kazuha's friend  and  Signora . [2]   The people of  Inazuma  revere the Musou no Hitotachi almost as much as the Raiden Shogun herself, as they believe no one can defend against it. As a result, it has become a symbol of the Raiden Shogun's power to protect Inazuma from all threats;  Kujou Takayuki 's hubris in his dealings with the  Fatui  stemmed from his overconfidence in the Musou no Hitotachi's power. The  Traveler  managed to escape death from Musou no Hitotachi twice: the first attempt was interrupted by  Thoma , who distracted the Shogun by throwing a spear at her, [3]  while  Kaedehara Kazuha  managed to block the Shogun's second attempt with the power of both his own  Anemo   Vision  and his deceased friend's reawakened Electro Vision. [4]     Known Practitioners [ ]   Ei   The Shogun   Trivia [ ]   After inheriting the  Musou Isshin  from  Makoto , the previous Electro Archon, Ei and the Shogun use it to perform Musou no Hitotachi. Musou Isshin's  Musou  ( Japanese :  夢想  \"Dream\" ) is a different  Musou  from the one in Musou no Hitotachi, which uses  無想  \"Blank mind\" , a state where one is free from all thoughts and desires.  In  Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu 's effect description, Musou no Hitotachi's  Musou  is written with  夢想  instead of  無想  in the Japanese version. The distinction is lost in the English description, although this wordplay is alluded to in the Talent's English flavor text.   While powerful enough to strike down even  Gods , it should be noted that the Musou no Hitotachi does not appear to be powered by Ei's  Gnosis . The strike that slew La Signora (who had been granted god-like executive power by the  Tsaritsa ) [5]  was dealt 500 years after she handed her  Gnosis  to  Yae Miko  after not being able to create a puppet to carry it for her.

    "Plane_of_Euthymia": "Plane of Euthymia               Type   Lore       Region   Inazuma       The  Plane of Euthymia  is the world inside  Raiden Ei 's mind, where her consciousness currently resides after she discarded her physical form around 400 years ago. [1]     Contents     1   Accessed During   2   Lore     2.1   Present Day       3   Trivia     3.1   Etymology       4   Notes   5   Other Languages   6   Change History   7   References   8   Navigation       Accessed During [ ]   The Plane of Euthymia is accessed during the following quests:    Archon Quest   Amidst Stormy Judgment  in  Chapter II : Act II -  Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow Archon Quest   The Omnipresent God  in  Chapter II : Act III -  Omnipresence Over Mortals The Lonesome Euthymia  in  Raiden Shogun 's  Story Quest ,  Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter : Act I -  Reflections of Mortality   Lore [ ]   In the past,  Yae Miko  taught Ei how to place her consciousness into objects. [2]  This technique allowed Ei to create the Plane of Euthymia, her inner world [1]  which she placed within the blade  Musou Isshin . [3]   The Plane of Euthymia is part of Ei's plan to achieve eternity for herself. Over 400 years ago, [Note 1]  she successfully created  the Shogun , an identical puppet whose body would not succumb to death or old age, and left this puppet in charge of pursuing Inazuma's eternity. Ei herself secluded to the Plane of Euthymia, a space which reflects her inner world, to meditate and prevent the erosion of her spirit. [1]  Ei can still monitor the outside world from within the Plane of Euthymia, and can assume control over the puppet's body at will. [4]     Present Day [ ]   In the past few hundred years since entering the Plane of Euthymia, Ei neither permits anyone to enter the Plane of Euthymia nor leaves the Plane to check on Inazuma. [4]  Because she only cares about affairs which directly pertain to eternity, she pays no attention to everyday life in Inazuma, and despite understanding the circumstances behind the  Vision Hunt Decree , deems this irrelevant to eternity and tacitly approves it. [2]   This state of affairs is finally broken during the  Archon Quest   Amidst Stormy Judgment  in  Chapter II : Act II -  Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow , after the Traveler interrupts the Vision Hunt Ceremony. The Traveler's ability to use the elements without a  Vision  marks them as an exception and thus an \"enemy of Eternity,\" causing them to be brought into the Plane of Euthymia for Ei to personally judge their strength. The Traveler's consciousness leaves the Plane after their defeat, but the fact that they met Ei at all piques Yae's interest. [4]   Traveler returns to the Plane of Euthymia during the  Archon Quest   The Omnipresent God  in  Chapter II : Act III -  Omnipresence Over Mortals , allowing Yae to enter using her connection to the  Grand Narukami Shrine Omamori  that she gave them beforehand. They show Ei the light of the Visions inlaid in the  Statue of the Omnipresent God [5]  which, combined with her defeat at the Traveler's hands, finally shakes her will and convinces her of the potential within human wills and dreams.  After the Inazuma Archon Quests, Ei turns off many of the Shogun's functions as she deliberates their future course of action in their pursuit of Eternity and declares that the Raiden Shogun is resting. The Traveler and Paimon visit the Shogun to investigate some concerns held by the people of Inazuma, and after receiving less-than-helpful replies from the Shogun, Ei brings them into the Plane of Euthymia. There, the two convince Ei to take a personal tour of Inazuma, leading her to visit Inazuma for the first time in over 400 years. [6]  Afterwards, Ei starts involving herself more with Inazuma's affairs and assumes control over the Shogun's body more often — which then leads her to conflict with the Shogun, who judges that Ei may have succumbed to  erosion . [7]     Trivia [ ]   The English localization of the  Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto Materials ' descriptions refer to  Raiden Makoto 's  realm of consciousness  as the \"Plane of Euthymia,\" but it is fundamentally different from Ei's Plane of Euthymia [4] [8]  and is never referred to as a \"Plane of Euthymia\" during the quests which involve it. Not even Yae Miko fully understands what realms of consciousness are, only that the nature of the space is different from those created by the technique of storing consciousness inside an object. [8]   In the original Chinese text, the text corresponding to \"Plane of Euthymia\" in the materials is simply  净土   Jìngtǔ , \"Pure Land,\"  whereas Ei's Plane of Euthymia is almost always referred to as the proper noun  「一心净土」   Yīxīn Jìngtǔ , \"Pure Land of One Mind.\"   Etymology [ ]   The original Chinese name refers to the Sino-Japanese concept of \"one mind\" ( Chinese :  一心   yīxīn ;  Japanese :  一心   isshin ), also translated as \"wholeheartedly,\" which is also referred to in several other terms related to the Raiden Shoguns, including Musou Isshin and the  Raiden Gokaden 's  Isshin Art .   Notes [ ]     ↑   According to Wanderer's  Character Story 2 , Ei entered the Plane of Euthymia the same year that the  Tatarasuna Mystery  occurred. In the  Archon Quest   The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call  in  Interlude Chapter : Act III -  Inversion of Genesis ,  Sawada  found government records which showed that the people involved in the Tatarasuna Mystery lived over 400 years ago.

[2]  As they were children, the Sunchildren could not truly rule competently, and were instead manipulated to commit heinous deeds as the nobles who controlled them profited from their misrule. Because of this, the Sunchildren would become hated by the people of Enkanomiya, who scapegoated them and blamed them for willful ignorance even though they were aware that the Sunchildren were being manipulated.  Despite their tyranny, the Sunchildren were still children: they led lonely lives and lamented their existences, but the officials tasked with taking care of them were forbidden from saying a word to them. [3]  The nobles knew that as the Sunchildren grew into adults, they would eventually realize they were being manipulated. [2]  To prevent this, they established a ceremony called the Rite of Solar Return where, when a Sunchild reached a certain age, they would be taken to the inner sanctum of the Dainichi Mikoshi, where they would be incinerated by the artificial sun's high temperatures. [2] [3]   During the time of  Rikoru , the first Sunchild, [4]  Aberaku realized the truth of the system the nobles had established and opposed them. In response, the nobles simply convinced Rikoru that Aberaku wanted to kill him and usurp his seat, had him accuse Aberaku of high treason, [2]  then imprison him under house arrest in the Dainichi Mikoshi for life. [5] [6]  Upon his death, his clothes and body were enshrined in various places in acknowledgement of his achievements. [6]   Eventually, an Enkanomiyan child would discover Orobashi, who was hiding in a cave due to having escaped from the  Archon War . The child would ask Orobashi to become their god, and he agreed, overthrowing the Sunchild's rule and becoming Enkanomiya's ruler. [5]   The  Divine Bridle  was the badge of the Sunchild's office.

    "Tatarigami": "Tatarigami               Type   Lore       Region   Inazuma       Area   Yashiori Island         Orobashi 's divine form was sundered along with the mountains, its ichor turned into plasma, and its will and power became a curse that could never be extinguished: Tatarigami. — Golden Branch of a Distant Sea   The  Tatarigami  ( Japanese :  祟り神   Tatarigami , \"Curse God\" ) is a curse that plagued  Yashiori Island ,  Inazuma , formed from the will and power of the serpent god  Orobashi  who was slain over the island. When the wards suppressing it are disrupted, it causes sickness and calamities around the island.  Before the  Traveler 's arrival, the wards over Yashiori Island were destroyed, causing a resurgence of Tatarigami and a stalemate between the  Shogun's Army  and the  Watatsumi Army . The Tatarigami manifest as a black aura around certain enemies in the island, and as a persistent storm overshadowing the island when players first explore the area.    Contents     1   Overview   2   History     2.1   Suppression and Exploitation   2.2   Present Day       3   Trivia     3.1   Etymology       4   Other Languages   5   See Also   6   Change History   7   References   8   Navigation       Overview [ ]   The Tatarigami spawned from Orobashi's will and power after  Raiden Ei [1]  slew it on Yashiori Island towards the end of the  Archon War . [2]   Areas affected by the Tatarigami experience perpetual thunderstorms, and plants grown in contaminated soil will wither away. [3] [4]   Exposure to Tatarigami typically causes mysterious, untreatable illnesses in humans, although the effects are mitigated for  Vision -bearers or those with another form of elemental sensitivity. Physical effects include random unstoppable bleeding from orifices, fevers, constant migraines, rashes, as well as dizziness and weakness. [5] [6]  Psychological effects include auditory hallucinations and insanity; notably, people's auditory hallucinations primarily revolving around an unknown god addressed as \"Him.\" [5] [7]  While raving about how  Chouji's mother  will not escape \"Him,\"  Washizu  describes this  god  as having \"eighteen pairs of blood-red eyes! Thousands of sharp, venomous fangs! Countless mouths and numberless tongues, ever thirsting after blood!\" [8]  In the  Lost Text  at  Fort Mumei , the author writes down his hallucinatory experiences, in which he describes witnessing \"three teeth\" which had \"something black ooz[ing] out of them\" as well as seeking some kind of treasure, before finally \"melting into 'his' whisperings.\"  Some people show particular resistance to the Tatarigami's corruption, although the phenomenon is not understood. While Chouji's mother fell ill, she remained in clear conscience and was relatively healthy compared to others affected, which  Yasumoto  suspects was caused by the Tatarigami's energy \"flowing freely inside of her\" instead of corrupting her. [6]  Among the residents of  Higi Village  who remained, neither  Chouji  nor  Yasumoto  display symptoms of being corrupted by the Tatarigami.  Objects have also been observed to be susceptible to the Tatarigami.  Akame Kanenaga  used the power of the Tatarigami to infuse his consciousness into  Kagotsurube Isshin , a blade he made while in exile in  Snezhnaya . He told the sword his wish to show Inazuma that the Isshin Art is still worthy of the  Raiden Shogun 's trust. However, the intrinsic hatred in the Tatarigami corrupted the sword, warping its goal into rivaling the gods at any cost, to the point where it possessed many humans until they were of no use in its journey back to  Inazuma . [9]     History [ ]   Suppression and Exploitation [ ]   After the rise of Tatarigami, The Raiden Shogun placed wards called  Narukami Pillar  to suppress Orobashi's soul, hence subduing the Tatarigami. [10]  The Yashiori Guardians, led by  Kitain Bunsou  and the Kitain Clan, also took up the mantle of suppressing the Tatarigami. [11] [12]   With the threat of the Tatarigami minimized, people from  Narukami Island  began mining  Crystal Marrow  from Orobashi's remains. The people of  Watatsumi Island , who continued to worship Orobashi, were greatly incensed by the exploitation of their god's remains. [13] [14]   In recent years, the  Mikage Furnace  was built at  Tatarasuna  at the behest of the  Tenryou Commission , using technology from  Fontaine  capable of harnessing the Tatarigami's energy to smelt  Jade Steel . This decision has been hotly contested by the priestesses of the  Grand Narukami Shrine , who believe that the Tatarigami are too dangerous to be trifled with. [15]     Present Day [ ]   Acting on orders from the  First Harbinger  to stall the war, [13]   Fatui  mole  Nathan  spurred Orobashi fanatics within the Watatsumi Army into damaging the wards on Yashiori Island [16]  while  Sangonomiya Kokomi  was away to negotiate with mercenaries. [17]  This led to a resurgence of the Tatarigami across the island and with it, mysterious ailments and poor weather which ground the conflict between the  Shogun's Army  and  Watatsumi Army  into a bitter stalemate. [5]   The Kitain bloodline had died out by this time, [11]  while  Tenryou Commission  head  Kujou Takayuki  refused to believe  Kujou Masahito 's reports about the severity of the Tatarigami situation; [5]  the Mikage Furnace's core, which had been damaged and was on the verge of a meltdown, could not be attended to by the Grand Narukami Shrine due to  Hanbei 's inaction and hostility from the Tenryou Commission soldiers stationed there. [15]  As a result, all Inazuman forces who could change the Tatarigami situation were preoccupied or unable to attend to the matter before the  Traveler 's arrival.  Over the course of the  World Quest  Series  Orobashi's Legacy , the Traveler helps  Kaji , a resident of the island, repair the Narukami Pillars. With each pillar repaired, its corresponding region is slowly cleared of the Tatarigami's influence. In the  World Quest  Series  Tatara Tales , the Traveler also assists  Xavier , one of the personnel in charge of creating and maintaining the Mikage Furnace, in repairing the furnace's core and fending off the  Fatui  forces attempting to use it for their own ends.  Despite the Traveler's aid, the ravages of the Tatarigami's influence can be felt throughout the island.  Higi Village  has been all but abandoned, with most of its inhabitants having either fled to either neighboring island for refuge, or died from illness or insanity. By the time the Traveler stumbles on the village, it has been reduced to a total of two residents, Yasumoto and Chouji, while the village chief, Washizu, had fallen to insanity.    Trivia [ ]   Etymology [ ]   In  Shinto ,  Tatarigami  ( Japanese :  祟り神 ) are powerful gods or spirits that bring all forms of calamity upon their victims, such as \"death and destruction, fire and famine, plague and war.\" In order to appease these spirits, shrines dedicated to them have been built across Japan in the hopes that their curses can be lifted.

[1]  Their great works would spark cultured discussions which caused Inazuma's culture to blossom and gain great influence at that time. As a sign of the appreciation for the great works of The Five Kasen that enriched the lives of the people of Inazuma, the  Irodori Festival  was developed.

[2]  During  Hues of the Violet Garden , the version that the party is told was devised by  Kamisato Ayato  to guide  Kaedehara Kazuha  to the truth regarding the fall of the  Raiden Gokaden  and the  Kaedehara Clan .    Members [ ]   The real names of The Five Kasen were lost over time.  However, the legend of The Five Kasen were once repeatedly adapted and performed on stage. Each character was dressed in a distinct color and soon, theatergoers referred to the members by their colors: Green for Suikou, blue for Aoi no Okina, red for Akahito, white for Sumizome, and black for Kuronushi. [2]     Suikou ( Japanese :  翠光  \"Green Light\" )   Aoi no Okina ( Japanese :  葵の翁  \"Elder of Sunflower\" )   Akahito ( Japanese :  赤人  \"Scarlet Man\" )   Sumizome ( Japanese :  墨染  \"Ink-Dyed\" )   Kuronushi ( Japanese :  黒主  \"Black Lord\" )   Stories [ ]   Ayato's Version [ ]   The legend of The Five Kasen that Ayato devised is recorded in the  The Five Kasen's Splendor  poem series:    The Five Kasen's Splendor: Suikou   The Five Kasen's Splendor: Aoi no Okina   The Five Kasen's Splendor: Akahito   The Five Kasen's Splendor: Sumizome   Trivia [ ]   During  Hues of the Violet Garden ,  Albedo  paints portraits of The Five Kasen-based primarily on members of the party assembled at Ayato's invitation:  Venti  is the basis for Suikou.   Xingqiu  is the basis for Aoi no Okina.   Kaedehara Kazuha  is the basis for Akahito.   Kamisato Ayaka  is the basis for Sumizome.   Scaramouche  (now  Wanderer ) is the basis for Kuronushi, although his portrait is only revealed after splashing the painting with water; without it, the portrait was left blank to allow viewers to freely interpret Kuronushi's appearance.   Venti's  Constellation  name,  Carmen Dei  ( Japanese :  歌仙座   Kasen-za ;  Chinese :  歌仙座   Gēxiān-zuò ), contains the same characters as  kasen  ( Japanese :  歌仙  \"immortal poet\" ) in-game languages that use Chinese characters.   The tale of The Five Kasen references a legend about Ono no Komachi. The role played by Ono no Komachi is split between Akahito and Sumizome within the event. [3]  In Noh and Kabuki theater variants of this legend, the antagonist is Kuronushi.  [4] [5]   Etymology [ ]   The Five Kasen are likely based on the  Rokkasen  ( Japanese :  六歌仙  \"six poetry immortals\" ), six renowned Japanese poets from the mid-ninth century whose works were included in the poetry anthology  Kokin Wakashū .  Kuronushi's name is directly derived from  Ōtomo no Kuronushi , one of the poets in the Rokkasen.   Sumizome is likely analogous to  Ono no Komachi . Both are the only women in their respective groups, and a legend about Ono no Komachi features her washing the ink of a poem away in order to exonerate herself from an accusation of plagiarism.  [3]   Akahito's name is not derived from one of the Rokkasen, and is instead based on  Yamabe no Akahito , who predates the Rokkasen. Akahito and the Rokkasen are all considered part of the  Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry  ( Japanese :  三十六歌仙   Sanjuurokkasen ).

Soil that has been affected turns white and is known as \"Holy Soil.\" By performing the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri, the spirits in Enkanomiya will be forced back down into the ocean and the erosion will be temporarily halted.  A piece of  Jade Coral Branch  from Enkanomiya is required to perform this ritual.

[2]             Jade Coral Branch       The Jade Coral Branch was created from  Orobashi 's own body and is used to suppress the  Dragonheir of the Depths .  Tsuyuko  believes that the threat of unsealing the Dragonheir is a possibility, but due to insufficient knowledge about what lies in the depths, there is no way of ascertaining the truth of these legends.  Tsuyuko's studies at the  Sumeru Akademiya  have given her a more scientific explanation for the origins of Watatsumi Island's soil erosion and the reason for the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri's efficacy in preventing it. She believes that Holy Soil is caused by the salinity and alkalinity of seawater that touches the land, which leaches nutrients from the soil and renders it unsuitable for agriculture. Jade Coral Branches, which were created from Orobashi's body and contain its power, have sufficient nutrients to replenish the soil and stave off the spread of Holy Soil.    Trivia [ ]   The legend behind the Goshou Rock seals bears resemblance to that of  Narukami Island 's  Sacred Sakura  and its  Cleansing Ritual , as well as the legend of the  Chi of Mt. Qingce  in  Liyue . In all three cases, five seals representing different aspects of an organism were placed to seal something away:  The Goshou Rocks separate Watatsumi Island from Enkanomiya, where the Dragonheir of the Depths has been sealed. The five seals are labeled Eye, Tooth, Fin, Tail, and Heart.   The Sacred Sakura and Thunder Sakura are suppressing an unknown creature that lies underneath  Kannazuka . [3]  The five seals are labeled Eye, Mouth, Hand, Feet, and Nose. [4]   The five seals around the Mt. Qingce area each suppress an aspect of the Chi, preventing its spirit from poisoning the land. The five seals suppress one of the following aspects of the Chi: spirit, bones, flesh, soul, and form. [5]   The concept of the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri loosely resembles the real life  Bon  (or Obon) festival in Japan, an annual event which honors and commemorates the spirits of one's ancestors. During the festival, one of the traditional preparations for the arrival of ancestors is the cleaning of grave sites. The festival celebrations culminate in the  Gozan no Okuribi  ( Japanese :  五山送り火  \"Five Mountains' Send-Off Fire\" ) or  Daimonji  ( Japanese :  大文字 ) on August 16, in which giant bonfires are lit on five mountains surrounding the city; to signify the guiding of ancestral spirits back to their dwelling place in the spirit world.  One such festival is the Mitama Matsuri ( Japanese :  みたままつり  \"Spirit Festival\" ), a mid-summer festival celebrated at  Yasukuni Shrine  in Tokyo since 1947 ( mitama  is an alternate reading for the kanji of  goryou ).   The ritual also shares similarities with some  Ryukyuan festivals , such as Shinugu in Okinawa; a harvest festival which involves a prayer to the sea gods and the use of branches to expel evil spirits.   In real life, water with high salinity indeed has a negative effect on plant growth.

    "Akasha_System": "Akasha System               Type   Lore       Region   Sumeru       The  Akasha System  was developed by  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata  by using her  Gnosis  and expanded on by  Sumeru Akademiya  after her death. It allows for the transfer and sharing of information via a device called the  Akasha Terminal  that is powered by the Dendro Archon's  Gnosis .    Contents     1   Background   2   Canned Knowledge     2.1   Divine Knowledge Capsule       3   Jnagarbha Day   4   Gallery     4.1   Knowledge Capsules       5   Trivia     5.1   Etymology       6   Other Languages   7   Change History   8   References   9   Navigation       Background [ ]   The Akasha Terminal is a unique piece of Sumeru technology invented by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and further developed by the Akademiya. [1] [2]  It takes the shape of an earpiece. It is capable of granting the user any sort of knowledge they desire to have, as long as they have the required credentials. Although this device can be used anywhere within the borders of Sumeru, its potency is best achieved in larger settlements such as  Port Ormos  or  Sumeru City . Everyone who arrives at Sumeru City is provided with one, the  Traveler  and  Paimon  included. In order to activate the device, the user must hold it in their hand and say the phrase \"May the Mighty God bless us with their voice of wisdom.\" Upon uttering this phrase, the device will instantly activate and be available for use. [3]  Aside from travelers and outlanders, it is also utilized by the majority of Sumeru's population. However, because of the old prejudice between the Desert and Rainforest people, when people originating from the Desert come to Sumeru City, they are automatically given lower clearance than people from the City no matter what their job is.  Prolonged use of the Akasha System and Canned Knowledge carries great risks: firstly, the knowledge asserts itself as true to the user and is difficult to forget, which makes it difficult to correct if the knowledge turns out to be wrong, and secondly, excessive use diminishes one's ability to think. [4]  Even experienced users have had difficulty perceiving the world accurately when the Akasha already funneled knowledge into them, as seen by Grand Sage  Azar  when he went to check  Lesser Lord Kusanali 's status. [5]   The Akasha Terminal is capable of harvesting the Jnana Energy of Sumeru's people, and is the reason people in Sumeru do not dream. [6]  By gathering people's dreams, the Akasha Terminal can combine the knowledge of all the people in Sumeru City, something  Dehya  likens to turning Sumeru City into a \"single, massive brain.\" [7]  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata created the Akasha System to \"borrow\" the dreams of her people and empower her, as she was unable to eradicate the second coming of the  forbidden knowledge  invading  Irminsul  with her strength alone. [1]  Recently, the Akademiya's sages maximized the Akasha's output by trapping the denizens of Sumeru City in a samsara, harvesting their dreams repeatedly as part of their plans to elevate  Scaramouche  to godhood. [8]   The Akasha System is also capable of computation. [9]  With this function, the Akasha System can produce new data, such as predicting the movement of certain persons based on their existing data. The Akademiya used this to escape the claws of  General Mahamatra Cyno  during his investigation.  Lesser Lord Kusanali is referred to as \"The First Akasha Terminal,\" and can enter anyone's mind as long as they're wearing their Akasha Terminal. However, she refuses to possess living beings unless absolutely necessary, instead opting to control  Katheryne  due to her being an artificial lifeform. [10]   A weaponized upgrade of the Akasha Terminal, the \"Neo Akasha Terminal,\" was created by Kusanali. This floating device assisted the Traveler in their battle against  Shouki no Kami .  After Kusanali was freed from the  Sanctuary of Surasthana , she chose to halt the usage of the Akasha System, as it had fulfilled its purpose in restoring Irminsul and she deemed it not beneficial for her people's well-being, even though it was pointed out that some may resent her for it. The system is no longer operational, as she gave up her Gnosis to  Il Dottore  following an information exchange. This in turn has also allowed the people of Sumeru to dream once more.  Before the Akasha System was shut down,  Moseis  was able to create imaginary, hyper-realistic models of people within a dream, requiring only a miniscule portion of the Akasha's Jnana Energy supply to do so. By transferring his consciousness to the Akasha, Moseis was able to become the host of that dream while still being fully awake, ensuring that it would never collapse due to him waking up. Thanks to signaling devices which he implanted on specific individuals, Moseis was able to continue harvesting Jnana Energy from them to fuel his dream, even after the Akasha was turned off. Additionally, those with the signaling devices planted on their bodies were thus connected to a network that allowed them to enter the dream. [11]     Canned Knowledge [ ]           Activated Canned Knowledge       Canned Knowledge is information contained within a Knowledge Capsule. Unlike the information from the Akasha System, which restricts access to knowledge based on the user's demographics, anyone can learn the information in a Knowledge Capsule. To use it, one must link it to their personal Akasha Terminal.  While Canned Knowledge is safe to use if used sparingly, the risks are such that the Akademiya has banned the possession, sale, and usage of Canned Knowledge across Sumeru, with those found guilty of those things having their right to study at the Akademiya revoked. [12]  Despite its illegality, extensive smuggling operations have been formed to create Canned Knowledge and sell it on the black market. Canned Knowledge is used by those who are dissatisfied with the information provided to them by the Akasha, like the Eremites, commoners, and some Akademiya students. [13]   Some Knowledge Capsules are higher in quality than others; more valuable ones are richer in  Dendro  energy and thus tend to show up brighter when using  Elemental Sight , though this is not always completely accurate. For example, once-useful knowledge may still shine brightly even when it has become less relevant in the modern day. [13]   The Canned Knowledge contained within Knowledge Capsules can be relatively obscure, ranging from \"An Analysis of the Sociological Ideology and Dialectics of the Hilichurls\" to \"An Introduction to Traditional Sumeru Brewing Techniques.\" Much Canned Knowledge has been leaked from the Akademiya itself. [13]   Lesser Lord Kusanali was able to extract Moseis' consciousness from the Akasha into a Knowledge Capsule so that it could be imported back into his brain. [11] [14]     Divine Knowledge Capsule [ ]   A Divine Knowledge Capsule is a Knowledge Capsule that supposedly contains the wisdom of the gods. Divine Knowledge Capsules glow bright red. The knowledge from Divine Knowledge Capsules is extracted from scholars that have gone mad trying to link their minds to Irminsul; [8]  the tree contains remnants of  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata 's consciousness, [10]   which is the source of the divine knowledge, but is also contaminated by forbidden knowledge, which drives the scholars insane. Anyone who attempts to draw knowledge from Divine Knowledge Capsules goes mad, as seen when  Mizri  violently attacks the Traveler and  Alhaitham  before muttering Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's last words, \"World... forget me.\" [15]  Sumeru Akademiya's sages seek to use the divine wisdom contained in the Divine Knowledge Capsules to turn Scaramouche into a god. [8]     Jnagarbha Day [ ]   Jnagarbha Day is a special occasion when the  Akademiya  enters new information into the Akasha System. [9]  Beside data for the general granting knowledge function, data of specific people can also be entered to make use of the Akasha's computation function. The Akademiya is typically more crowded than usual during Jnagarbha Day.  After Lesser Lord Kusanali shut down the Akasha System, Jnagarbha Day was no longer needed.

The records are imprinted on the  akasha  (aether), and are said to be accessible to select individuals. [16]   Jnagarbha is likely derived from the Sanskrit compound  jñānagarbha  ( Sanskrit :  ज्ञानगर्भ, lit.  \"knowledge-womb\" ); which can be translated to mean \"filled with knowledge,\" or \"knowledge matrix.\"   Other Languages [ ]     Language Official Name English Akasha System Chinese (Simplified) 「虚空」 \"Xūkōng\" Chinese (Traditional) 「虛空」 \"Xūkōng\" Japanese 「アーカーシャ」 \"Aakaasha\" Korean 「허공」 \"Heogong\" Spanish Akasha French Akasha Russian Акаша Akasha Thai Akasha Vietnamese \"Akasha\" German Akasha-System Indonesian Akasha System Portuguese Sistema Akasha   Change History [ ]   Released in  Version 3.0 [ Create New History ]   References [ ]     ↑  1.0   1.1   Archon Quest, Chapter III, Act V -

    "Diadem_of_Knowledge": "Diadem of Knowledge               Type   Lore       Region   Sumeru       The  Diadem of Knowledge  is a famous crown regarded as a valuable treasure in  Sumeru . Wearing the Diadem of Knowledge is considered a great honor and was the right of the winner of the  Interdarshan Championship  for the last twenty years.    Contents     1   Appearance   2   Lore   3   Gallery   4   Notes   5   Other Languages   6   Change History   7   References   8   Navigation       Appearance [ ]   (To be added.)     Lore [ ]   The Diadem of Knowledge is said to have been built by a famous craftsman \"in ancient times\" and is recorded in old books. It is also said to have \"a secret that no one knows.\" [1]   A little over twenty years before the events of  A Parade of Providence , after  Sachin  returned to  Sumeru City  disheartened from his years in the desert, he happened to be in a position to purchase the Diadem of Knowledge, and he sold many of his assets to do so. [2] [Note 1] [Note 2]  Sachin kept the Diadem of Knowledge in a storage room in his house, from which the other members of the household would begin to occasionally hear a high-pitched voice, presumably of unknown origin. Sachin himself would also enter the storage room and research the diadem non-stop for a period of several days. [2]   Sachin eventually discovered that the diadem could \"preserve part of one's consciousness\" and \"placed [his] experiences\" into it before signing the contract to entrust or donate his properties, including the Diadem of Knowledge, to the Akademiya shortly before the next  Akademiya Extravaganza . [2] [3]  After the Diadem of Knowledge was donated to the Akademiya, it was added to the Interdarshan Championship to be worn by the winner of each competition in accordance with Sachin's wishes. [4]   The same year that the Diadem of Knowledge was donated to the Akademiya, an Interdarshan Championship was held. During the final round, Sachin revealed himself to  Kaveh's father , who was likely mentally assaulted with Sachin's words and emotions via the Diadem of Knowledge. [Note 3]  Kaveh's father was negatively affected enough that an  Aranara  named  Arakasyapa , who still remembered being taught how to read and write in a human script by Kaveh's father as a child, took away the Diadem of Knowledge and hid it in a tree hollow, [3] [5] [Note 4]  where it would later be found by the employee who was in charge of the Diadem of Knowledge. [1]  However, the damage had already been done, and Kaveh's father fell into depression. His actions afterward due to the empathy and kindness in him that caused Sachin to take notice of him in the first place would eventually lead to his early death. [6]  While the change in the personality of Kaveh's father was noticeable, his encounter with Sachin went unreported and undiscovered.  The Diadem of Knowledge was used in every Interdarshan Championship in the twenty years that followed, seemingly without incident. [2]  Sachin's consciousness in the Diadem of Knowledge, through which he watched every Interdarshan Championship in hopes of finding a suitable inheritor for his research and wealth, [Note 5]  remained undetected the entire time by everyone [4]  except  Nahida . [7]   In the Interdarshan Championship held during A Parade of Providence, Nahida enlists the help of the  Wanderer  to keep an eye on the competition and intervene if anything went wrong. During the opening ceremony, the Diadem of Knowledge was displayed, causing the  Traveler  — and only the Traveler — to have a vision of Sachin onstage when they looked at it. [8]  Later in the competition, Sachin decided on  Kaveh  as his successor. In the final round, during which the participants fought to be the one to place the Diadem of Knowledge on a stand,  Layla  and the Wanderer hold the diadem without any noticeable effects. However, when Kaveh is finally in possession of the diadem, it begins leaking black wisps. [2]  Kaveh then hears Sachin's voice in his head and is mentally assaulted by Sachin's emotions and ideas, giving him a splitting headache. [7]  When Kaveh places the diadem on the stand to complete the final round, an image of Sachin materialized.  Sachin's explanation of his research upset Kaveh, so he threw the Diadem of Knowledge to the ground, dramatically breaking it into pieces after it had survived for an indefinitely long time intact. After the Diadem of Knowledge was broken, the image of Sachin dissipated. [2]  When Kaveh talks about the crown's effects, he says it was like it was brainwashing him. According to Alhaitham, the crown appears to only have adverse effects on empaths and idealists who can understand Sachin's ideas, explaining why he was able to interact with Sachin's research and Layla and Wanderer were able to interact with the crown normally, whereas Kaveh, who is both of these things, experienced pain.  It is unknown what happened to the fragments of the Diadem of Knowledge, but they are presumably in the care of the Akademiya due to the value of the crown and the secret of the crown being exposed. However, Dori implies that the destroyed crown is now worthless.    Gallery [ ]   The image for the Chapter  A Parade of Providence   Notes [ ]     ↑   The following narration places Sachin's acquisition of the Diadem of Knowledge after his time in the desert led him to his disheartened conclusion about human nature: Sachin:  Twenty-eight years ago, I came to the desert and lived there for eight full years. [...] [...] Sachin:  The things I witnessed there tormented me greatly. I wished desperately to find a way to save them. [...] Sachin:  But in the end, I found that the answer I sought simply did not exist. [...] Sachin:  After this realization, I could no longer see the meaning in anything that I had ever learned. Consumed by an overwhelming sense of emptiness, I could no longer bear to face life... and so I decided to bring my life to an end. Sachin:  But before I went through with it, a strange twist of fate led me to come into the possession of this diadem, which has the ability to preserve part of one's consciousness. Into it, I placed my experiences, before requesting that the Akademiya manage my estate.     ↑   It is more likely that Sachin sold his assets after he returned to Sumeru City than while he was still in the desert, as selling enough assets while in the desert would require Sachin either to be able to sell them while away from them or to have enough of them on his person in the desert, neither of which seem plausible.     ↑   This conclusion is based on the mental experience that Kaveh has with the Diadem of Knowledge, as shown in  To Claim the Crown , explained by Kaveh himself in  The Arc of Intellect , and further supported by Kaveh's declaration in  When the Curtains Close  that with the diadem shattered, Sachin's words will never hurt anyone again.     ↑   \"That Incident From Twenty Years Ago\"  indicates that after the final round, Arakasyapa hid the Diadem of Knowledge in a tree hole in order to protect the human who taught it how to read.  The Contestant  suggests that the human was the same human who helped Aaru Village and died in quicksand.  When the Curtains Close  shows that the human spoken of in  The Contestant  is Kaveh's father, as deduced by both the Traveler and Alhaitham.     ↑   According to the excerpt of Sachin's words in  Suspicions Aroused , Sachin stated that he would watch for suitable candidates in the Interdarshan Championship \"[e]ach year.\" This conflicts with Wiqas's statement in  Opening Festivities  that the Interdarshan Champion is held every four years and is seemingly supported by Kareena's statement in  To Claim the Crown  that the Diadem of Knowledge \"has been used in every Extravaganza,\" which occurs yearly due to the yearly Wisdom Gala. However, at the end of  To Claim the Crown , Sachin says the reward of his wealth was meant to \"draw out the worthiest of individuals,\" making it clear that he was specifically watching the Interdarshan Championships.

    "Eleazar": "Eleazar           Dark, hardened scales are a symptom of Eleazar       Type   Lore       Region   Sumeru       Eleazar  was a chronic illness that was unique to  Sumeru . [1]  It is a manifestation of  The Withering  on the human body [2]  and is positively correlated with a person's elemental content. [3]   Eleazar was eradicated upon the cleansing of  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata 's tainted consciousness from Irminsul in the  Archon Quest   Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies  in  Chapter III : Act V -  Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises , but it had no cure prior to that event.    Contents     1   Overview   2   History   3   Confirmed cases   4   Trivia     4.1   Etymology       5   Other Languages   6   Change History   7   References   8   Navigation       Overview [ ]   Eleazar is a manifestation of the Withering on the human body, [2]  and commonly presents as dark, hardened scales growing on a person's body, with slight numbness in the affected area, causing clumsiness. As it advances, patients experience fatigue and progressive nerve damage, particularly as the scales develop into ulcers and eventually necrose. [4]  Patients ultimately become unable to control their own bodies and are rendered immobile. [5]  The afflicted may also fall into a coma as the disease progresses. [4]   The typical conditions for the onset of Eleazar have not been detailed, but  Collei [6]  and  Dunyarzad [7]  were born with Eleazar, while the late Arbaaz was described as \"little,\" [8]  suggesting he was rather young when he was admitted to the Eleazar Hospital.  From the Diagnostic Report of an unnamed doctor — likely  Zandik , who is also heavily implied to be  Il Dottore  — people with Eleazar have a higher elemental content than ordinary people. [3]  While there is no true cure for Eleazar, [5]  it can be controlled by managing and reducing elemental quantities within the bodies of those affected by Eleazar. [3]  While testing his theory, the unnamed doctor found a treatment that was able to make a late-stage Eleazar patient's symptoms disappear completely. [3] [4]   Il Dottore and  one of his subordinates in Sumeru  successfully suppressed Collei's Eleazar symptoms by infusing her with a god's remains (originally translated as  archon residue ); [9] [10]  however, she was not only deeply traumatized by her experiences during her treatment, [5] [11]  but also left with an unstable power over \"black fire\" and experienced other \"plague\"-like symptoms. [12]  After  Cyno  sealed the god's remains inside her body, these side effects disappeared, [13]  but she was then taken to  Tighnari  at  Gandharva Ville  for care due to the reemergence of her Eleazar symptoms.  Nilotpala Lotus  can be used to help those suffering from Eleazar to recover energy, [5]  and the forests of Sumeru are also effective at mitigating the effects of Eleazar, [14]  though the mechanism through which the forest alleviates the symptoms is unknown. However, the Withering has not only affected the forest, but has drastically worsened the effects felt by those afflicted by Eleazar.    History [ ]   One of the earliest occurrences of Eleazar, or symptoms that closely align with those of Eleazar, is recorded in  Kasala 's memories.  King Deshret  inadvertently brought  forbidden knowledge  to his people, causing darkened scales to cover people's bodies and people heard crazed whispers in their minds. The land was wrought with death and destruction and even with Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's help in erasing forbidden knowledge, King Deshret ultimately sacrificed himself to seal it away and his civilization collapsed. [15]   Sometime in the past,  Sumeru Akademiya  built a hospital at  Dar al-Shifa  in the  Great Red Sand  to study Eleazar and conduct research into treatments for the disease. A certain doctor, whose name was scrubbed out of extant records, found a successful treatment utilizing an unknown material. All that is known about it is that the \"Specimens\" saw this treatment as \"blasphemous\" due to their belief that Eleazar is inflicted as divine punishment. [3]   Abbas , a 23-year-old patient at the hospital, was the lone survivor out of a group of four and managed to escape the hospital by tunneling underground. [8]  The hospital was later abandoned for undisclosed reasons, and the Akademiya has barred all access to its ruins. [16] [17]   The  Fatui , led by Il Dottore, have also undertaken research on Eleazar and its treatment through the use of gods' remains. One of Dottore's subordinates obtained test subjects by claiming the Fatui had a cure and tricking parents into giving their Eleazar-afflicted children to them. Collei's parents were among those who handed their children to the Fatui. [5] [18]  While the Fatui performed their experiments in the desert, it is unclear whether they used the Eleazar Hospital in Dar al-Shifa, or if it was in another area of the desert; all that is known is that the facility has since become \"charred ruins.\" [18] [19]   Cases of Eleazar are increasing in Sumeru City, and residents with symptoms are encouraged to go to  Bimarstan  for treatment.

It converts people's belief in justice into Indemnitium, a power source used in the Court of Fontaine and  Erinnyes . [1]   Aside from serving as a power generator, the Oratrice also appears to have a consciousness of its own and delivers judgment with accurate sentences at the Opera Epiclese. How and why the Oratrice can do this are the subjects of  Lyney 's curiosity and he theorizes it may have something to do with the prophesied crisis. [1]  Regardless of what the  Chief Justice  believes during the trial, they must honor the results of the Oratrice.  It is later revealed that Focalors was contained within the Oratrice and that only a fraction of Indemnitium produced by the Oratrice was ever used to power Fontaine; in reality, most of it went to give the Oratrice enough power to execute Focalors and destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne. This action returned the Hydro Archon's power to the  Hydro Dragon  to forgive the people of Fontaine of its \"Original Sin\" and save them from the  prophecy .    Contents     1   Overview   2   Gallery   3   Other Languages   4   Change History   5   References   6   Navigation       Overview [ ]   Fontaine  runs on a \"very special\" energy system and has been plagued with power issues for centuries, which has led Fontainians to be concerned for the sustainability of this system. [2]  The Oratrice collects people's belief in \"justice\" during the \"process of 'judgment'\" and turns it into Indemnitium, which provides energy for various amenities in Fontaine, including lamps and transportation systems. [1]  It is later revealed that only a small fraction of the Indemnitium was ever used to power Fontaine; if it were not for Focalors' own plan, the amount of energy that the Oratrice had accumulated over 500 years would have been able to power Fontaine for millennia.  An impending energy crisis between 400 and 500 years ago led  Rene  and  Jakob , two members of the  Narzissenkreuz Institute , to search for a solution in the  Khaenri'ahn  ruins at the  Girdle of the Sands . [3]  Their discoveries were brought back to  Alain Guillotin , who went on to devise the Pneuma-Ousia  Arkhe  system which continues to power the  Clockwork Meka  to this day. [1]   Settlements such as the Court of Fontaine and the island of Erinnyes continue to be powered by the Oratrice. [1]  Even with the Arkhe system in place, wholly replacing the Oratrice has been difficult and research into alternate energy systems has continued. While members of the  Fontaine Research Institute  are focused on developing entirely new systems, [2]  Lyney appears to believe the mysteries behind the Oratrice are the key to resolving Fontaine's issues. [1]   During the trial against Lyney and  Lynette  by  Furina , the Oratrice listened to the case then shifting its scales after hearing arguments and objections from both sides. After learning that the entire trial was an accident caused by  Liliane  and that  Cowell  was the actual perpetrator, the Oratrice gave a non-guilty verdict to both him and  Lynette . Lyney attempted to investigate the Oratrice per  Father's  request, but was forced to retreat when he heard a voice from the Oratrice that appeared to know him, which also contaminated him with a large quantity of Indemnitium.  During the events of  As Light Rain Falls Without Reason , the Oratrice ended up giving a guilty verdict to  Tartaglia  despite having been cleared of charges stemming from the mysterious disappearance cases, leaving both Neuvillette and Furina surprised and baffled by the result, as it was the first time since its operation it did not agree with the Chief Justice's view. This prompted Neuvillette to personally investigate the machine and Tartaglia's case himself while Furina managed to cover up the machine's error through dramatics and bravado. Through his investigations, Neuvillette discovered that Childe had fallen into the  Abyss  when he was younger and accidentally awakened the  All-Devouring Narwhal , but remained unconvinced that that was the reason the machine declared him guilty, offering the possibility that Focalors was deliberately using him to buy time by holding the All-Devouring Narwhal off.  When  Arlecchino  had a meeting with Furina (as a tea party), after Neuvillette had sealed the  Primordial Sea  from engulfing Fontaine, she asked her about her plan to stop the  prophecy . Furina claimed that she had a plan, though Arlecchino doubted her claim. Based on what she had learned from Lyney, she surmised that someone was accumulating Indemnitium for an unknown cause but did not go further into the matter and quickly changed the subject.  As the prophecy began to loom over Fontaine, the Traveler and Neuvillette concocted a \"trap\" to make Furina reveal her hidden secrets to avoid it. The Traveler deduced her of being a fraud, gaining the support of the audience through various evidence they obtained in their encounters. The Oratrice agreed with Neuvillette's judgment of her being guilty, but gave a verdict condemning \"the Hydro Archon\" to the death sentence, even though the trial was held precisely to prove that Furina was not the Archon, surprising everyone present. The death sentence in particular caused much shock and horror for the audience as it was a penalty that was never been handed out before, to the point that some thought its availability was a mere myth.  Focalors later met with Neuvillette inside of her consciousness, revealing her intricate plan to deceive the  Heavenly Principles  and save their people; The Oratrice was never an enactor of justice and instead a device to kill the God of Justice, constantly accumulating Indemnitium within the Oratrice in the last 500 years. Focalors would use the acquired Indemnitium to kill herself and destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne, restoring Neuvillette's full authority as the Hydro Dragon Sovereign. Neuvillette also realized that the Oratrice's call for the death sentence of \"Hydro Archon\" refers to neither Furina or Focalors, but to the Divine Throne of Hydro Archon itself. After Focalors executed herself, the Oratrice is now non-functional and no longer provides Indemnitium for Fontaine's needs, [4]  though Neuvillette's restored authority allowed him complete control over Pneumousia energy to serve as a substitute for the time being. Neuvillette also decided to take over its role in court trials and he will personally hear all cases and pass verdicts going forward.

    "Primordial_Sea": "Primordial Sea               Type   Lore       World   Teyvat       Region   Fontaine       The  Primordial Sea  is a sea located under  Fontaine . It once existed on the surface of the planet and is where most life in  Teyvat  first originated from. [1]  One known large passage connecting the now-underground Primordial Sea to the surface is located under the  Fortress of Meropide , [2]  however smaller pools of Primordial Seawater can also be found in other underground areas. [1]   Originally, some of the  Oceanids  created by the first Hydro Archon  Egeria  longed to become human, so Egeria used the Primordial Sea's life-granting properties to give the Oceanids human forms. These Oceanids and their descendants would become the humans of Fontaine, but as their forms were derived from the Primordial Sea, coming into contact with the Primordial Sea's waters would cause them to dissolve into water and turn back into Oceanids. Egeria's creation of life without permission angered the  Heavenly Principles , who declared that Egeria and the now-human Oceanids to have sinned, an \"original sin\" that all Fontainian humans from that point on were born with. [3]  The Heavenly Principles decreed a  prophecy  stating that, one day, the water levels in Fontaine will rise and dissolve the people of Fontaine to absolve them of their sin, leaving only the Hydro Archon alive, weeping on her throne. [4]   Following  Neuvillette 's rise to full dragonhood, he gained his  predecessor 's control over the Primordial Sea. He used it to \"forgive\" all Fontainians of their original sin, using the life-giving properties of the Primordial Sea to turn the Fontainians into true humans. Nowadays, the Primordial Sea is no longer a threat to Fontainians.

Fontainians who come into contact with pure Primordial Seawater will have their bodies dissolve into water, but their consciousness merged into it. However, non-Fontainians who come into contact with it will instead simply gain increased sensitivity to the  Hydro  element. [1]  The ancient  Remurian  people were aware of the Primordial Sea's life-granting and life-taking properties, and had a prophecy of their own in which the Primordial Sea would one day swallow all life, and anything which did not originate from it would be filtered out as waste. [5]   People who are dissolved into the Primordial Sea will have their memories merged into it, although their consciousnesses appear to be able to retain some level of individuality. This is seen in the \"Oceanid\" that was formed in the  Fountain of Lucine  from the consciousnesses of  Vacher 's lover  Vigneire  and his victims that flowed back to the Fountain alongside the Primordial Seawater used to dissolve them. [1]  According to legend, God-King  Remus  used golden Ichor and pure water to remove people's souls from their bodies and implant them into golems. [6] [Note 1]   Water of the Primordial Sea can have its potency reduced by mixing it with other liquids or diluting it. God-King  Remus  attempted to mix insoluble Ichor with pure water, believing that memories and wisdom could be contained with it and thus allow his subjects to surpass the limitations of mortal bodies and gain eternal life; however, ordinary life cannot handle the separation of soul and body, and Remus' ambitions only served to ultimately destroy his nation. [7]  In modern times,  Sinthe  has been manufactured by diluting Water from the Primordial Sea, which does not cause people to be dissolved into water but instead imparts them with an addicting sense of euphoria. Prolonged consumption of Sinthe causes many side effects, such as becoming unable to focus or control one's emotions, and withdrawal symptoms include flashes of paranoia and anxiety as well as severe loss of energy. [8]  Sometime later, the Fatui diver Freminet found himself in the water near the Fortress of Meropide when the Primordial Sea began to leak into it, and he mostly just exhibited symptoms of exhaustion and suffocation suggesting that even heavily diluted it can rob a Fontaine Vision wielder of their ability to breathe underwater.    History [ ]   According to Hydro  Vishap  legend, in the beginning the Primordial Sea had a composition similar to that of blood, and that life within it was not individual. Life that evolved to walk on land or fly in the skies thereby formed blood vessels to keep the waters of the Primordial Sea within themselves. The  Hydro Dragon  was said to have been the \"beating heart\" that controlled the Primordial Sea. [9]   Oceanid  legend further states that after the Hydro Dragon was removed from its position, the  Ruler of Life , one of the  Four Shades  of the  Heavenly Principles , created a new heart for the Primordial Sea. This heart was  Egeria , who would eventually become the  Hydro Archon . [9]     In Remuria [ ]   Life that came from the primordial sea is inevitably fated to return to it. But there are infinite possibilities for humans to transcend, and even the waters of the primordial sea cannot completely dissolve them... — Boethius ,  Sublimation of Pure Sacred Dewdrop   Remurian legend claims that \"before the birth of life, there was a dense primordial sea. It is the purest origin of all things, and one day, it will also swallow all life... and those things which did not arise from it will be filtered out, becoming naught but floating detritus.\" [5]   When Remus first appeared on the Primordial Sea,  the first sovereign  gave him a goblet of water which he later used to \"refine\" water from the Primordial Sea and establish Remuria. [10] [11]  The refined substance was golden Ichor, [12]  which Remus aimed to replace the Primordial Sea with. [13]     Egeria's Rule [ ]   During  Egeria 's rule, the Oceanid subjects of hers would all go on to long for human life. They begged Egeria to grant human life to them, which Egeria used the Primordial Seawater as a replacement for human blood in order to give these Oceanids life. This action awakened the  Heavenly Principles , as Egeria did not have the proper authority to create human life and for using the powers of the Primordial Sea. Following this act, the now-human Oceanids would have judgment cast upon them by the Heavenly Principles, and would be tarnished with 'Original Sin'. This sin is what triggered the prophecy that Fontainians would all dissolve within the rising seawaters, in order to wash away the nation's sins.  At some point during Egeria's rule, the  Fortress of Meropide  was constructed by criminals seeking Egeria's forgiveness and mercy, who told them to head to the depths to protect her secret underneath the waves, which was an entrance to the Primordial Sea. The criminals covered up the entrance with a sluice gate and over time, various measuring contraptions were added to monitor the level of Primordial Water in the area. This area was restricted to only the Warden and trusted people, though it was eventually forgotten by most of the prison's inhabitants as the years passed.    Cataclysm [ ]   During the  cataclysm  500 years ago, the waters of Fontaine were tainted by the power of the  Abyss . Although that taint has since been diluted and cleansed, no  Oceanids  could naturally be born from Fontaine's waters outside of the few pure containers of water that still remain. [14]   Idyia  also states that Fontaine's water suddenly became bitter with pain and hate, forcing the Oceanids who survived the cataclysm to take refuge in other sources of pure water for survival. [15]   After Egeria died at  Tunigi Hollow  during the cataclysm, her body transformed into a body of water known as  Amrita Pool , housing the purest  Amrita  which can purify the power of the Abyss with the help of the  Khvarena , which spread across the area after the Khvarena  Simurgh  merged her powers with the Amrita's. It is unclear whether the Amrita Pool's water is the same as the Primordial Sea's, but  Zurvan  calls the Amrita the \"Primordial Amrita,\" and the  Pari  — the Khvarena created from Simurgh which have sentience — return to the Amrita over time. [16]     Over 400 Years Ago [ ]   The Primordial Sea became a research subject for the  Narzissenkreuz Ordo .  Jakob Ingold 's research conclusions were later used as the basis for Marcel's research, [1]  although his exact writings have not been disclosed. At some point, the  Master , also known as Narzissenkreuz and  Rene de Petrichor  would eventually descend into the Primordial Sea, waiting to be freed to bring about his own world to prevent the apocalypse he had foreseen.    Present Day [ ]   According to  Neuvillette , the Primordial Sea no longer existed on Teyvat's surface. [1]  Marcel, original name Vacher, researched the properties of the Waters of the Primordial Sea in hopes of reviving his lover, Vigneire; the two had accidentally stumbled into a pool of its water while on an expedition; because Vigneire hailed from Fontaine, she dissolved into water, but was unable to tell Vacher to forget about her before she did so.  In the process, he discovered that diluting the water created an addictive drink which imparted the drinker with a sense of euphoria, marketed it as \"Sinthe,\" and made a fortune by selling it to the people of  Poisson  via dealers. However, Sinthe also had drastic side effects of harming both drinkers and abstainers alike, resulting in  Callas  ordering a ban on the product in Poisson. He managed to convince one of the sellers,  Jacques , to be his informant, though Marcel was aware of this and ordered Jacques to kill Callas, though he could not, so a third party was hired. The assassin was successful in killing Jacques, but not Callas, while Marcel had Primordial Water poured on the man to dissolve him and cement Callas as the killer. Callas was aware of this but did not do anything in order to protect his daughter  Navia , as she was targeted by Marcel's organization and he would subsequently die in his duel against  Clorinde . [1]   Meanwhile, Marcel used the funds he acquired from Sinthe production to continue his research into reviving Vigneire, only to encounter failure after failure. By the time his deeds were discovered during the Fontaine Archon Quests, over 25 women had been dissolved over the course of 20 years, creating a recurring criminal case which was dubbed the \"serial disappearances case\". He was never considered a suspect for the previous disappearances, as he had always managed to frame someone else for it. [1]   While Marcel was found guilty by the  Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale  for his crimes, it likewise declared  Childe  guilty for an unknown reason, causing him to be sent to the Fortress of Meropide, but he escaped to follow the voice he kept hearing in his head. A year prior to the Traveler's arrival to Fontaine,  Wriothesley  noticed that the dashboards in the  Forbidden Zone  were increasing, though he was not certain as to the cause.  Arlecchino  sent  Lyney ,  Lynette  and  Freminet  to the prison to gather information and locate Childe. During the investigation, Freminet attempted to track Childe's route back out to a sewer opening but discovered that the ocean water at the place was diluted with Primordial Water, causing him to pass out and was saved by Clorinde, allowing Wriothesley to deduce that the readings were actually monitoring the levels of Primordial Water and that the prison was built to stop it from enveloping Fontaine. Soon after, the water encased behind burst down the sluice gate, but Wriothesley and Clorinde were able to keep it at bay long enough for Neuvillette to arrive, push the water back and implement a new seal.  Childe, who had tried to follow the voice, ended up falling unconscious. When he came to, he found himself in the depths of the Primordial Sea, along with a massive,  narwhal-like  entity swimming in front of him. This narwhal was present in the sea for a prolonged period of time, consuming any energy it could find inside; this also caused the sea's levels to rise. The two soon entered a brawl, with Childe's actions delaying the beast long enough to prevent it from emerging in Fontaine earlier.  The water would eventually leak out from  Poisson  and the surrounding area, causing some people to be dissipated into water, including  Melus  and  Silver . The narwhal, which had consumed all it could from the Primordial Sea, then emerged in the  Opera Epiclese  to consume Fontanians, as they had its water in them. Neuvillette, having learned the entire truth from  Focalors , had his Authority restored after the latter killed herself to fulfill the Heavenly Principles' demand and knowing that Neuvillette would try to protect the people after having served as their Iudex for centuries. Neuvillette, with his Authority restored, declared their sins absolved, turning their faux blood in their bodies into real blood, effectively making them \"true\" humans. He then had the Traveler accompany him into the sea to kill the beast, though they only managed to subdue it before  Skirk  arrived and sent it back into the Abyss alongside an unconscious Tartaglia. As Skirk talked about her master and other prominent individuals, she also reminded them about the prophecy which was about to enact as the beast was now defeated with its consumed energy returning to the sea.  The Primordial Sea then engulfed Fontaine in water, but because the Fontanians were now true humans, the water did not dissolve them, though many people were left drenched in the process. The water then proceeded to recede back into the Primordial Sea, where it would cause no further problems and the people of Fontaine began recovery efforts. [17]   During another one of their adventures, the Traveler, alongside  Seymour ,  Ann  and  Caterpillar , would forge the  Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz  to stop Jakob and the Master from creating their own world. After breaking the four seals, they headed to the  Tower of Ipsissimus  where they encountered and defeated Jakob, who chose to die in the hopes of seeing Master's new world. The group made their way through the tower, collapsing it into the sea, which broke another seal leading to the Primordial Sea. Inside, the Traveler and Ann defeated the Master, who then realized that his world-formula was wrong and agreed to leave with them to see the current world. After they left, Ann resealed the tower to ensure that the waters would not flood into Fontaine.  Following the prophecy being fulfilled, the amount of Primordial Water on the surface of Teyvat greatly diminished, and whatever was left is implied to be impure. Vacher's gang, still revolving around the use of Primordial Water, scramble to find other ways to utilize it for their criminal activities, though the Fontanian authorities are on their tail.    Fontemer [ ]   While it is currently unclear exactly what Fontemer is, it may be related to the Primordial Sea, as  Fontemer Aberrants  are said to have potentially evolved from ordinary aquatic lifeforms as a result of \"environmental factors specific to Fontaine.\" [18]  Fontemer is also capable of accepting and being controlled by others, who are said to be capable of receiving blessings from  Xenochromatic Creatures . [19]     Notes [ ]     ↑   While Pulteney relegates folklore about \"soul-stealing magisters who entrapped mortal spirits within specially-made magical golems\" to mere legend, it is corroborated by  Sublimation of Pure Sacred Dewdrop  and  Movement of an Ancient Chord . The former mentions that Remus used Ichor and pure water to separate souls from their bodies, while the latter claims that \"To save their waning civilization and their desire to transcend, the Golden Troupe played melodies most wondrous, enticing children to offer their precious souls to the sleeping golems.\"       Other Languages [ ]   Primordial Sea   Language Official Name Literal Meaning English Primordial Sea — Chinese (Simplified) 原始胎海 Yuánshǐ Tāihǎi Primal Embryonic Sea Chinese (Traditional) 原始胎海 Yuánshǐ Tāihǎi Japanese 原始胎海 Genshi Taikai Primal Embryonic Sea Korean 원시   모태   바다 Wonsi Motae Bada Spanish Mar Primigenio Primal Sea French Mer primordiale Primordial Sea Russian Первозданное   море Pervozdannoye more Primordial Sea Thai ทะเลบรรพกาล Thalae Banpakan Primordial Sea Vietnamese Biển  Khởi Nguyên Khởi Nguyên 起源 Primordial Sea German Urmeer Primordial Sea Indonesian Lautan Primordial Primordial Sea Portuguese Mar Primordial Primordial Sea Turkish Ezeli Deniz Italian Mare primordiale Fontemer   Language Official Name Literal Meaning English Fontemer — Chinese (Simplified) 原海 Yuánhǎi Primordial Sea Chinese (Traditional) 原海 Yuánhǎi Japanese 原海 Genkai Primordial Sea Spanish Fontamar Fontemer French Fontemer — Russian Фонтмер Fontmer — Thai Fontemer — German Fontemer — Indonesian Fontemer — Portuguese Mar Primordial Turkish Fontemer — Italian Fontemer —   Change History [ ]   Introduced in  Version 4.0 [ Create New History ]   References [ ]     ↑  1.0   1.1   1.2   1.3   1.4   1.5   1.6   1.7   Archon Quest, Chapter IV, Act II -

When the  Heavenly Principles  arrived, they deposed the  Hydro Sovereign  and usurped its Elemental Authority over the Primordial Sea in order to create the first human beings on Teyvat. [4]  To further solidify their control, they also created a new \"heart\" for the Primordial Sea — the later Hydro Archon,  Egeria  — and bestowed upon her both the authority over  Hydro  and the guardianship of the Primordial Sea, effectively replacing the Hydro Sovereign. [5]     Egeria's Sin [ ]   Egeria also had familiars born of pure water known as Oceanids. During Egeria's reign, many of her  Oceanid  subjects expressed a wish to live human lives. However, given their nature as elemental beings, they would not be able to do so unless they were somehow turned human. [6]   Hearing their pleas, Egeria granted their wish by using the life-granting powers of the  Primordial Sea , pouring Primordial Seawater into their blood vessels and giving them humanoid forms to live on land. However, this came with a caveat; if they ever came into contact with Primordial Seawater of a high enough concentration, their faux blood would seep back into it, collapsing their human forms and turning them back into regular Oceanids who would return to the sea devoid of the sense of self and individuality they possessed as human beings. [6]  In any case, the humans Egeria created organized into various tribes who worshiped her as the Mistress of Many Waters.    Egeria's Punishment [ ]   Despite Egeria's benevolent intentions, she had not been granted permission from the  Heavenly Principles  to create a new \"human\" race. [6]  To punish Egeria for thieving the power of the Primordial Sea, [6] [7]   Celestia  decreed that all of the now-human Oceanids would be branded with \"Original Sin\" to reflect their illegitimate origins. This set in motion the prophecy that foretold that all of them will one day be dissolved back into the Primordial Sea during a great flood, washing away the sin of their existence in a show of ultimate justice.  Celestia then imprisoned Egeria inside the Primordial Sea and tasked the dragon  Scylla  to guard her. Here, she was visited by her contemporary god  Remus , who sought answers to stave off the prophesied destruction of his own people, the nation of  Remuria . She granted him a cup of Primordial Seawater, which he processed into a substance called Ichor that gave him the ability to transfer the essence of his human subjects into new bodies of eternal, unaging stone. Remus hoped that these immortal bodies would grant his subjects the ability to transcend their fate. However, the plan failed as Remuria was still destroyed by a great flood [8] ,  sinking deep underwater  and taking with it the souls of countless Remurians still trapped inside their insoluble stone bodies. [9]   After the  Archon War , Celestia released Egeria from her imprisonment, granted her a  Gnosis , and placed her onto the seat of the Hydro Archon. After ascending into her new role as God of Justice, she helped many of the exiled criminals of Fontaine build a new home, the  Fortress of Meropide , which also served the secondary purpose of guarding her \"secret\" deep beneath the water: a large opening into the Primordial Sea. The fortress grew larger and eventually became a home for these sinners. [10]  Egeria perished in the cataclysm 500 years prior to the start of the game without finding a solution for saving her people from the prophecy, instead leaving behind an ominous conundrum for her  successor .    Recent Events [ ]   Focalors' plan [ ]   After Egeria's death during the  Cataclysm , Focalors, one of the Oceanids who were turned human, would rise to Archonhood.  Focalors  judged that the only way to circumvent the prophecy was by deceiving fate itself into thinking it had been ostensibly fulfilled, while simultaneously saving the people of Fontaine in reality. To this end, she split her godhood away from her human vessel,  Furina . Furina acted in Focalors' stead for 500 years to deceive Teyvat and the Heavenly Principles into believing this human was the true Hydro Archon. Focalors hid her divine self, alongside the  Hydro Gnosis , within the confines of the  Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale . [7]   Focalors would use the trials that continuously occurred in the  Opera Epiclese  to convert the faith of her people during these trials into an energy source called  Indemnitium . Only a fraction of Indemnitium was used to power the everyday lives of Fontainians, and the majority of it was secretly accrued inside the Oratrice so that on the day that the prophecised disaster finally struck, she would have obtained enough power to both sentence herself to death and destroy the Divine Throne of the Hydro Archon itself, shattering the yoke of the Heavenly Principles over Fontaine once and for all. [7]   The next part of Focalors' plan involved absolving the Fontainians of their branding with Original Sin, which meant they would become bonafide humans who would no longer dissolve into the Primordial Seawater. This judgement could only be passed by someone who possessed the Elemental Authority of Hydro and the ideal of justice which it represented. When the time came for her execution, she would return the Authority stolen by Celestia to its original owner: the  Hydro Dragon Sovereign , whose current incarnation was  Neuvillette . Despite being born in human form, Neuvillette initially held little regard for humanity and was quite undecided regarding the purpose of his own life. Focalors invited him to serve as the Iudex of Fontaine and preside over its trials, hoping that the long years of experiencing an array of human emotions at court would enable him to understand humanity and want to protect them. Thus, when the Authority over Hydro would be restored to him, he would exonerate the humans and overrule the sentence of guilt Celestia had placed upon them. [7]     Present Day [ ]   While the  Traveler  was incarcerated in the  Fortress of Meropide ,  Wriothesley  showed them a large sluice gate in the  Forbidden Zone  locking the Primordial Sea below the fortress. Wriothesley confirmed that if the gate failed, then all of Fontaine would be dissolved into the sea. This risk led Wriothesley to build his own ship,  The Wingalet , as a precaution against the prophecy. The ship was inspired by the legend of  Remuria  where King  Remus  took the Golden Bee and rode the Fortuna over the waters. [10]   On the day that the prophecy would ultimately come true, Furina was made to stand trial by the citizens of Fontaine on charges of deceiving her people by hiding her true identity and to pressure her into confessing her secrets. Just as prophesied, she was judged guilty by the people of Fontaine, their Chief Justice Neuvillette, and the Oratrice itself in the most historical trial in the nation's history. Shortly after she was found guilty, a  colossal whale  broke into the Opera house, attracted by the \"blood\" of the Fontainians. [6]  It was warded off by  Childe  in his  Foul Legacy  form, and would later be defeated by Neuvillette and the Traveler. [7]   As planned, the Hydro Archon received the death sentence. Focalors used the power of her amassed Indemnitium to execute herself and destroy the position of Hydro Archon, granting Neuvillette full authority over the element of Hydro, and freeing Furina from her curse in the process. Neuvillette, with his newfound authority over Hydro, absolved the people of Fontaine of their \"original sin\" and used the powers of the Primordial Water to convert their faux blood into real blood, turning them into \"true\" humans. [11]  During their battle against the All-Devouring Narwhal, Neuvillette separated the beast's consumption of Primordial Water, allowing him and the Traveler to subdue it. The battle resulted in its roiling Hydro energies overwhelming Teyvat's deep seas, flooding Fontaine as the prophecy foretold; however, as the people of Fontaine were now truly human, they were not dissolved into water, and the waters receded just as fast as they flooded the nation. [7]  Unfortunately, those who had already been dissolved were not restored.    Slates [ ]   These are a series of slates found in ruins south of  Poisson , depicting stages in the root and progression of the prophecy.    The first slate, depicting Egeria creating Fontainians from Oceanids. The second slate, showing Celestia enacting punishment on Egeria's and the Oceanids' kin for the sin of creating a new human race. The third slate, allegorically depicting the Hydro Archon standing on trial, with the water symbolizing justice, according to Neuvillette. The fourth and last slate, depicting a flooded Fontaine and the Hydro Archon solely weeping on her throne.   Trivia [ ]   The story of the Fontaine prophecy makes references to the  original sin ,  flood myth , and  Noah's Ark  in Christian theology.

It induces short-term feelings of euphoria, but in the long term, it causes side effects such as losing the ability to focus or control the drinker's emotions. Many families were destroyed by the abuse of Sinthe. [1]   Vacher  created this drink after discovering the effects of Primordial Seawater after being diluted with normal water. He manufactured and marketed it to fund his experiments, earning a lot of money through doing so. Following Marcel's arrest and the truth of the plot, his Sinthe production line was stopped, and the Fontaine authorities are currently working to confiscate any Sinthe still in the market.

It was proven that those effects, said to be caused by the ingredient wormwood, were not significant compared to the alcohol in absinthe.   The Chinese term for Sinthe,  乐斯   Lèsī , is possibly derived from the semantic meaning of the character  乐   lè , \"joy, pleasure,\"  referring to the euphoriant effects of the drink, and the Chinese transliteration of absinthe,  艾碧 斯   Àibì sī . Absinthe is also more commonly known as  苦艾酒   kǔ'ài-jiǔ , \"wormwood wine\"  in Chinese, with  艾   ài  as a contraction of the full transliteration of the name derived from its core active ingredient.

    "Ancient_Name": "Ancient Name           Ororon 's Ancient Name stone       Type   Lore Natlan Culture         Someone had this to say about Ancient Names: \"Our forebearers carved 'miracles' into obsidian rock, yet future bearers looked upon them and saw 'strength.'\" The miracles of the past become the motivations of the present. The limitations of the past become the breakthroughs of today. — Pacal   An  Ancient Name  (or  tocaitl ) is a title borne by certain members of the  six tribes  of  Natlan , as well as a special obsidian stone representative of the title. Each Ancient Name is associated with the heroic deeds of its previous bearers. The continuation of an Ancient Name from one person to another is a way of preserving the tribe's history. [1]     Contents     1   Receipt   2   Privileges and Responsibilities   3   Stone   4   Ancient Names and Their Bearers   5   Trivia     5.1   Etymology       6   Notes   7   Other Languages   8   Change History   9   References   10   Navigation       Receipt [ ]   A tribe's  Wayob  selects a worthy member of the tribe to inherit each Ancient Name, although the exact reason for their selection may not be known to the recipient. Alternatively, the  Pyro Archon  can commission a new Ancient Name for an individual that they deem to merit one, although several strict conditions must be met, and the smith in question must also be extremely skilled. [2]  Typically, only memories and experiences of Natlanese people while in Natlan are recorded by the Night Kingdom and can thus be acknowledged by the Wayob to be used as the basis for an Ancient Name. Because of this, only people from Natlan have historically received Ancient Names. However, in recognition of the  Traveler 's deeds in rescuing  Kachina ,  Mavuika  promises to grant one to them, leaving to  Xilonen  the problem of determining how to accomplish this without the requisite memories. [3]   The receipt of an Ancient Name is considered a special honor. Their deeds under the Ancient Name become part of its legacy and become a source of inspiration for later bearers. However, an Ancient Name can be lost if it is not passed on, causing the deeds of its past bearers to be forgotten. This may happen if the person dies in the  Night Warden Wars  without anyone in their group returning victorious. Mavuika states that  Tenoch  lost his Ancient Name while still alive, likely due to his status as an exile. The forging of new Ancient Names allowed Natlan, over time, to replace the loss of Ancient Names by their bearers' deaths in the Night Warden Wars. [1] [2] [4]     Privileges and Responsibilities [ ]   Ancient Name bearers are required to participate in the  Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame . They are typically expected to lead a team in the first phase, and the leader's strength is commonly seen as being the principal factor in the team's success. While it is permitted for a team to have more than one bearer, this can be viewed as a sign of cowardice. [1]   The bearers that win the Pilgrimage are usually required to fight in the Night Warden Wars against the  Abyss , although the Pyro Archon can release someone from this obligation.  Atea [5] ,  Chanca [6] , and  Vichama [7]  have all been exempted from going to fight due to injuries.  If at least one member of a combat team returns victorious from the Night Warden Wars, the slain members of the team can be brought back to life via the  Ode of Resurrection . However, if an entire team falls, its members cannot be revived. The tales of their acts are eventually forgotten, and their Ancient Names are lost; hence the phrase, \"The victors shall burn bright, while the losers must turn to ash.\" [1]   Six of the Ancient Names are associated with the  Heroes of Natlan . In the present day, six warriors received these Ancient Names prior to their acknowledgement by the Wayob to mark their selection as the modern heroes.  According to  Xilonen , the usage of an Ancient Name to commit a crime was unheard of, and upon capturing  Tlazolli  doing so, it was unsure how the  Children of Echoes  would proceed with her punishment. [8]     Stone [ ]   Each inheritor of an Ancient Name receives a special obsidian stone in the shape of a feather. These Ancient Name stones (sometimes simply referred to as Ancient Names themselves) are crafted by specially commissioned artisans such as Xilonen (and formerly, her mentor,   Tlazolli ). Glowing characters from the  Latin-Based Language  of Teyvat appear on both sides of stone, writing out the Ancient Name in syllabic form (e.g.  Umoja  is written with the characters for  UMJ ). The process of forging an Ancient Name stone also involves engraving it with the deeds of the Name's first bearer, though these engravings do not appear to be visible on the final product.

Six of them, one from each  tribe , were selected during the  cataclysm , while the other six were rallied in the present day.

A tribeless warrior named  Tenoch  gathered six other warriors, one from each tribe, to fight back against the Abyss; these became the original six heroes. The Abyss was eventually repelled from Natlan, but the tribes were left shattered and without hope. At this time, the  Pyro Archon ,  Mavuika , formed a plan to rebuild the tribes to fight the Abyss. As each tribe was reunited and its  Wayob 's strength restored, the Wayob would acknowledge a hero, signaling the tribe's readiness for war. These heroes will have inherited an Ancient Name borne by one of the original heroes. The original hero would manifest to the newly-selected hero and bestow upon them all their knowledge and memories, making them aware of their part in the plan. Because Natlanese  Archons  have normal human lifespans and this plan would take many lifetimes to bring to fruition, Mavuika sacrificed her life to the  Sacred Flame  in order to be revived to lead again at the culmination of the plan.    Present Day [ ]   At the time that the  Traveler  arrived in Natlan, Maviuka had returned as the Pyro Archon, but due to the Abyssal interference in the Night Kingdom, only three of the modern heroes had been acknowledged: Iansan, Kinich, and Xilonen.  After  Kachina  failed to return from the Night Kingdom despite the team having been victorious, Mualani immediately volunteered to look for her, alongside Chasca, Iansan and the Traveler. They found her in the Night Kingdom as an  Abyss Lector  named  Comonqui  appeared and began to mock Kachina. Mualani perked Kachina back up and the two defeated the Lector. Due to Mualani's acts of kindness to Kachina, the Wayob acknowledged her and thus they now had four heroes prepared for Mavuika's plan. [8]   While investigating  Capitano 's plan regarding Natlan, the group discovered that he and Ororon sought out a Source Mechanism in order to rewrite Natlan's Ley Lines, which could stop the invasion at the cost of everyone losing their heritage. They tracked them to a cave, but Ororon activated the device. Rather than rewriting the Ley Lines, the mechanism instead awakened the Lord of the Night,  Yohualtecuhtin , emitting a cry that resulted in Ororon collapsing due to his fractured soul. Ororon fought with  Guthred  over control of his own body, who wished to take his body to continue serving Capitano. Ororon, realizing that his life now had meaning, was able to expel Guthred's soul from his body and resulted in him being acknowledged by the Wayob. [3]   Ororon's new status as the second to last of the six modern heroes resulted in the Abyss increasing the frequency of its attacks, culminating in a massive nation-wide invasion in an attempt to kill the Natlanese before the last hero could be discovered. During the invasion, the Flower-Feather Clan was hit the hardest, prompting Chasca and  Chuychu  heading to the  Stadium of the Sacred Flame  to help out. Monsters ambushed and infected Chuychu, resulting in her dying despite the Traveler's attempts to purify the energy from her. Chuychu's death greatly anguished Chasca and caused a flare-up of the latent Abyss energy within her, but she was able to compose herself due to the Traveler's presence. This in turn resulted in her being acknowledged by the Wayob as the final hero for the plan, and with all six heroes assembled, Mavuika channeled  Ronova 's power to herself, allowing the Natlanese to repel the invasion. [1]     Incantations [ ]   There are six known incantations, resonating with the Ancient Names of the heroes. [1]     Tupac   \"As long as blood still runs through your veins, even the tiniest spark of steel against stone can ignite a flame. Its blaze will become one with the gaze of all Natlan. Even amid everlasting darkness, our bonds remain eternal.\"   Sundjatta   \"Stone engraved and echoing peaks. Converge, disperse, in ashes be reborn. For flames born anew, and the blazing dawn.\"   Wanjiru   \"A hero scaled the volcano to seize the sun. Anointed with flames, she shone with the light of a thousand stars. Now, guide me in my first step.\"   Sanhaj Kompore   \"Having foretold his own death, the omniscient man holds a feast in celebration. Let us raise our cups in honor of his heroism and send him off with this final tribute. For, at last, his wish is now fulfilled.\"   Burkina   \"By past fuel, and present flame, life marches ever on.

Natlan, lacking stable and deep-rooted  Ley Lines , suffered more under the invasion than any other nation. A tribeless warrior named  Tenoch  gathered six other warriors, one from each tribe, to fight back against the Abyss; these became the original six  Heroes of Natlan . Although the Abyss was ultimately repelled from the overworld, they continued to invade the  Night Kingdom , gradually weakening the  six tribes'  connections to the  Wayob . If the Night Kingdom were completely lost to the Abyss, Natlan would lose the ability to resist. However, in the aftermath of the invasion, the tribes were left shattered, and its people did not have hope for the future. [1]   The  Pyro Archon  at that time,  Mavuika , gathered the heroes, and together they formed a plan to save Natlan. They knew that they only repelled the Abyss because the tribes were united. To free the Night Kingdom, they would have to restore each tribe's strength and reunite. As the connection between each tribe and its Wayob was restored to its original power, the Wayob would select a hero, which would receive the  Ancient Name  of one of the original six heroes that fought during the Cataclysm. When all six tribes were restored and the six heroes gathered, Natlan would be strong enough to drive the Abyss from the Night Kingdom once and for all. Mavuika sacrificed herself, placing her life in the  Sacred Flame , so that she could reemerge near the time that the tribes were ready to take the offensive against the Abyss. [1]     The Pilgrimage and the Ode [ ]   In order to restore the strength of the tribes, warriors needed to be found who could be sent to fight the Abyss. The  Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame  was established to identify Natlan's strongest warriors. Those who prevailed in the Pilgrimage and who were Ancient Name bearers would be sent to fight the Abyss in the Night Warden Wars. The Pilgrimage also results in the generation of  Contending Fire , which fuels the Sacred Flame. [2]   Natlanese warriors had a key advantage: Should they fall in battle, the Pyro Archon could enter the Sacred Flame and raise them to life once more via the  Ode of Resurrection . There were two requirements for the Ode to be successful: First, the subject must be an Ancient Name bearer. (For this reason, non-bearers were not sent to the Night Warden Wars.) Second, at least one member of the deceased's team must have returned victorious. If the entire team falls, they cannot be restored. The souls of those who are not brought back via the Ode are stranded in the Night Kingdom, and their Ancient Names are eventually forgotten and lost. [2]   The warriors who are not lost to the Night Kingdom eventually retire when they become too old to fight or suffer a major injury, but continue to serve Natlan in other ways. Eventually, they pass away normally, and their Ancient Name is inherited by another warrior. In this way, the history and heroism of Natlan is preserved from one generation to the next. [2] [3]     Mavuika's Return [ ]   By the time that the  Traveler  arrived in Natlan, Mavuika had returned as the Pyro Archon to oversee the tribes' preparations to retake the Night Kingdom. However, only three of the six modern heroes had received the acknowledgement of the Wayob, who had become infected by the Abyss, further weakening their connection to the tribes. [1]   As a result of this interference,  Kachina 's Ode of Resurrection failed. To ensure that no other warriors risked being lost without a way to resurrect them, Mavuika suspended the Pilgrimage and sending anyone to the Night Warden Wars, essentially falling back from the Night Kingdom to defend the overworld. This created a dire situation, as the Sacred Flame was running out of Contending Fire to fuel it and was in danger of going out. Without it, Natlan would permanently lose the ability to resurrect warriors, and would inevitably be overrun by the Abyss. As a stopgap, Mavuika sacrificed her Archon power to feed the Sacred Flame. [4]     The Modern Abyss Invasion of Natlan [ ]   Through a series of dangerous encounters and with the assistance of the Traveler, Kachina was rescued and two of the remaining heroes received their acknowledgements. In an attempt to prevent Natlan's final hero from being acknowledged, the Abyss launched a full-scale invasion of Natlan. This attack resulted in a great many casualties, including  Chuychu ,  Chasca 's sister. Her death, however, triggered Chasca's acknowledgement as the final hero. [5]   The Heroes gathered at the  Stadium of the Sacred Flame , where together they were able to call upon the  Ruler of Death  to empower Mavuika and extend the blessings of the Ode of Resurrection to all Natlanese warriors, even those without Ancient Names. With this power behind them, Natlan turned the tide of the war and drove the Abyss back to the Night Kingdom.

We are the inheritors of memory and legend.  Those who grew alongside sun and wind.  Those who forged our own destiny and future.  That is Natlan's fire, the lifeblood of our nation.      At the conclusion of the eulogy, the  Pyro Archon  steps into the  Sacred Flame  to seek the deceased and their Ancient Name in the  Night Kingdom . Meanwhile, those gathered in the stadium bow their heads in respect and sing:      The tale continues on  Glory passed through generations  Courage ignites the sky and earth  Once more, victory heralds Natlan's path  We'll wait for you, we'll sing for you  Come back, brothers, come back, heroes  Once again, once again, burn bright!      The Pyro Archon then emerges from the Sacred Flame with the resurrected individual.    The First Failed Ceremony [ ]   The Ode for  Kachina  was presided over by  Mavuika  and officiated by  Ntotila . When the Ode concluded, Mavuika emerged from the Sacred Flame alone, and reported that neither Kachina nor her Ancient Name could be found in the Night Kingdom. This resulted in speculation by the crowd, incited by  Tepexpan  and  Tamuin , that Kachina may not have actually been worthy to be selected. Mavuika refuted this, declaring Kachina a hero. She suspended the  Pilgrimage  due to the uncertainty of being able to revive fallen heroes, and initiated an investigation into Kachina's failed resurrection.  Mavuika later confided to the  Traveler ,  Paimon ,  Mualani ,  Iansan ,  Chasca , and  Kinich  that unrest by the Abyss in the Night Kingdom prevented her from finding Kachina. Until it could be resolved, the Ode would continue to fail. Without their warriors being resurrected, Natlan would fall to the Abyss. Suspending the Pilgrimage would at least prevent further warriors from being sent to a war when they couldn't be revived. Chasca suggested continuing to hold the Pilgrimage in order to continue fueling the Sacred Flame, but without sending the victors to the Night Warden Wars. Mavuika pointed out that this would take away the prestige of the Pilgrimage, competitor numbers would drop, and the result would still be that the flow of  Contending Fire  would cease, extinguishing the Sacred Flame. [1]     The Start of the Night Wars [ ]   With the six heroes gathered, Mavuika was able to temporarily call upon the power of the  Lord of the Night  to extend the blessings of the Ode to all Natlanese warriors, whether or not they bore an Ancient Name. This permitted Natlan to repulse the Abyss invasion from the overworld, as casualties effectively dropped to zero from that point on. [2]     Trivia [ ]   The Ode's melody and lyrics are an excerpt of the  Natlan  soundtrack, and are sung in Swahili.

    "Pilgrimage_of_the_Return_of_the_Sacred_Flame": "This article is about the tournament. For the  Archon Quest , see  Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame (Quest) .       Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame     Type   Natlan Culture       The  Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame , sometimes shortened to just the  Pilgrimage , is a yearly tournament held in  Natlan .    Contents     1   Overview   2   Other Languages   3   Change History   4   References   5   Navigation       Overview [ ]   Due to the overwhelming number of participants, the tournament is divided into two phases. The first phase is a team competition, in which teams usually led by  Ancient Name  bearers as team captains, participate in various battles across Natlan to capture  Contending Sparks  and return them to the  Stadium of the Sacred Flame  within a time limit. Defeat in combat, departure from the contest grounds, and running out of time all lead to elimination. Participants from the winning teams move on to the second phase, which is composed of individual one-on-one matches. [1]  There is a pre-registration form that each contestant is required to fill out (along with an optional, supplemental single-page form for personal information such as hobbies and the people closest to them). [2]  The team leaders are expected to register their team and team members at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame before evening the day before the competition begins. They are then duly informed by tournament staff that dinner, entertainment, and lodging for the night are free for contestants and their friends and family, courtesy of the  Pyro Archon . [1]   Contestants are expected to act with a certain amount of decorum with each other, though each year there are a few 'sore losers' when eliminated; the Pilgrimage symbolizes glory, and some people can't accept missing out on the chance to claim it. Harassing other competitors still in the running can lead to tournament staff issuing a warning, but if such behavior persists, offenders can be barred from future competitions. [3]   While being defeated is the most common way to be eliminated, after individual pre-registration and team registration, contestants often try to ensure they turn up on time the morning of the tournament. Sleeping in (alcohol-induced or otherwise) and showing up late will get one's entire team disqualified. [4]   Those who win the Pilgrimage are acclaimed as heroes and the Ancient Name bearers take part in the  Night Warden Wars , a continuous battle against the invasion of the  Abyss . Aside from this, another purpose of the Pilgrimage is to collect Contending Fire, a substance only produced in battles between Natlanese. Contending Fire serves to fuel the Sacred Flame, which protects Natlan from the Abyss as long as it keeps burning. For this reason, outlanders are prohibited from participating.

It is through the Sacred Flame that the  Pyro Archon  can raise a warrior back to life during the  Ode of Resurrection . During the Ode, the Archon steps into the flame, retrieves the fallen warrior from the Night Kingdom, and they exit the flame together. When a new Pyro Archon ascends, the Sacred Flame grants them the knowledge and memories of Natlan. [1] [2] [3]   The Sacred Flame is fueled by  Contending Fire  produced in combat between Natlanese warriors. When necessary, objects which have become imbued with Contending Fire can be burned to sustain it. With Natlan's present deteriorating condition,  Mavuika , given no other choice, sacrificed her own power to keep it burning. [4] [3]   Five hundred years ago, as part of her plan to save Natlan, Mavuika put her life into the Sacred Flame, which allowed her to return to life to become the Pyro Archon again sometime before the  Traveler  arrived in Natlan. [3]   Smaller flames split off from the Sacred Flame are used in the  Turnfire  Night ritual conducted by the  Scions of the Canopy . They can also be used by the player to light certain braziers in Natlan. [5]   The Sacred Flame was temporarily extinguished by  Gosoythoth 's manifestation in Natlan. Mavuika later used the power of the Pyro  Gnosis  to restore the flame and displace Gosoythoth from over the Stadium.

It was used by the tyrant  Och-Kan  to rule over  Natlan  and oppress anyone who opposed him. [1]   Yupanqui , who used to be friends with Och-Kan, turned his back on him because of his tyranny. Yupanqui stole the Turnfire and threw it at the Och-Kan's army. The soldiers could not defend against it, and they would all be turned to ash along with the city. Although Och-Kan was not here. Thinking he heard Och-kan's voice, Yupanqui took a glance back, causing him to be consumed by Turnfire, his body would burn for a hundred days and eventually pierced a hole right through the  Ley Lines , falling in the  Night Kingdom .  According to legend, Turnfire is still burning in the Night Kingdom to this day.

The Wayob choose certain tribal members to inherit  Ancient Names . While the Wayob are not physically present in Natlan, they can appear there in the form of  Wayob Manifestations . It is unknown to the people why the Manifestations appear, although it is believed that they are sent to solve some problem. [1]   The survival of Natlan's people is tied to the Wayob. Due to the longstanding effects of the Abyss, without the protection of the Wayob, Natlanese people will suffer memory loss and emotional issues. The Wayob's protection does not extend past Natlan's borders, as they cannot extend it outside of Natlan's borders without expending power reserved for fighting the Abyss. Accordingly, Natlanese people almost never leave Natlan, and can only do so after receiving the approval of the Wayob via the tribal chief. With the  Abyss 's invasion of the Night Kingdom, the Wayob became infected with Abyssal energy. This greatly reduced their connection to the people, posing a grave danger to all of Natlan.

    "Art_of_Khemia": "Art of Khemia     Type   Lore       Region   Khaenri'ah       The  Art of Khemia  is a form of  alchemy  that was developed in and primarily used by the people of  Khaenri'ah . Because Khaenri'ah was an underground nation with little natural fauna, the Art of Khemia focuses on the creation of life; its capabilities are vastly different from those practiced in the Seven Nations of  Teyvat .  500 years ago, the Art of Khemia was a major factor in the fall of Khaenri'ah during the  cataclysm .

The chalk: that is you. The earth is where alchemy gets its name, and is the basis of all life. And this... This is new birth. — Rhinedottir , as she demonstrates the Art of Khemia to  Albedo , Albedo's  Character Story 3   Details about how the Art of Khemia was developed or how it works are currently unknown. Those who have attained the pinnacle of learning and alchemical prowess are capable of creating synthetic life, the \"apex achievement\" of alchemy. [1]  Currently, the only known person to have attained this level of ability is \"Gold\" Rhinedottir.  The Art of Khemia played a major role in the cataclysm 500 years ago, which resulted in the destruction of Khaenri'ah at the hands of the  gods . [2] [3]  As such, both  Dainsleif  and  Venti  — who were present for the fall of Khaenri'ah — express their apprehension over Albedo's practice of it.    Synthetic Lifeforms [ ]   When the pinnacle of attainment in alchemy is combined with unimaginably vast learning... the apex achievement is the creation of human life. —Albedo, about his existence as a synthetic human,  The Snowy Past   While Rhinedottir created many monsters, whose invasion of Teyvat contributed to a large part of the conflicts during the cataclysm, she considered only two of her creations to be \"miraculous beings\": the dragon  Durin  and Albedo, her successful synthetic human.  The star-shaped mark on Albedo's neck was left after sealing the area where life force was infused into his vessel. He likens it to a birthmark and a  pontil mark  left on glassware made through  glassblowing . [4]   Before she created Albedo, Rhinedottir produced another  \"abandoned experiment\"  during her Primordial Human Project. After deeming it a failure, she apparently had him devoured by Durin, allowing him to eventually re-emerge after Durin's death over  Dragonspine .

It would only last two weeks before wilting. But if you were to pluck one and take it out of Khaenri'ah, the petals would stop growing and turn hard. Only when it finally returned to its home soil would the petals grow soft once more, and finally turn to dust... So the Inteyvat is a symbol for a wanderer far from home, signifying the tenderness of the homeland. — Dainsleif  in  Memories of Inteyvat   Inteyvat flowers consist of five petals: four white and one light blue. The carpels and stamens of the flower are yellow, with the exception of Lumine's in-game model, of which the flowers' central parts change color based on the  Element  she is currently aligned with.  These central parts are shown to have the ability to glow. [3]  Inteyvat stems are a slightly darker purplish-blue.  During their travels across worlds, the  Traveler  wanted to find a place in the universe where Inteyvat flowers bloomed in full bloom. At the end of their journey across  Teyvat , the  Traveler's Sibling  found such a place, known as  The Sea of Flowers at the End . [4]     Trivia [ ]   Judging solely by the shapes of the flowers in-game and classifying this plant in already existing families, the Inteyvat's inspiration could have been based on the families  Rosaceae  (the rose family),  Malvaceae  (the mallow/hibiscus family), or  Boraginaceae  (borage/forget-me-not family).

    "Foul_Legacy_Transformation": "Foul Legacy Transformation               Type   Lore The Abyss       Foul Legacy Transformation  is a combat technique utilized by  Tartaglia . He has used it during his boss fight,  Enter the Golden House , as well as in a cutscene during his  Story Quest   Mighty Cyclops' Adventure! . He attempted to use this technique during the events of  As Light Rain Falls Without Reason  following his guilty verdict by the  Oratrice , but he was instead incapacitated by  Neuvillette  before fully transforming. During the events of  Masquerade of the Guilty , he would use the technique to prevent the  All-Devouring Narwhal  from consuming  Fontainian  civilians. [1]   While under the effects of Foul Legacy Transformation, Tartaglia is able to wield the powers of his  Hydro   Vision  and  Electro   Delusion  at the same time. However, using this ability is extremely draining on him and has lasting repercussions on his body; his fight with the All-Devouring Narwhal left him severely injured, resulting in him returning to  Snezhnaya  in order to recover. [1] [2]   This power does not originate from his Delusion; he learned it from  Skirk  after he fell into the  Abyss , before he joined the  Fatui . [3] [4] [5]     Contents     1   Characteristics   2   Trivia   3   Other Languages     3.1   Foul Legacy / Foul Legacy Transformation   3.2   Foul Legacy - The Devouring Deep       4   Change History   5   References   6   Navigation       Characteristics [ ]   When Tartaglia activates this ability, he grows to twice his size and dons a black and violet armor. He also now levitates off the floor and moves around at breakneck speed.  His armor is primarily black, with a violet fade from his midriff to his upper thighs. His torso sports his original outfit's collar, and his  Hydro   Vision , with a lavender, feathery collar at his neck. He also wears a long cape with a starry pattern. His armor extends to his arms, as well, with his fingers now wearing sharp gray claws. At his navel is his Electro Delusion. His legs are also armored, complemented by a silver lining, and a violet diamond pattern where his kneecaps are. Finally, his mask takes a new form, covering the entirety of his face, and elongating to sport long horns at his head. The face of the mask is featureless, save for a single purple eye.    Trivia [ ]   While \"Foul Legacy Transformation\" (or simply \"Foul Legacy\") ( Chinese :  魔王武装  \"Demon King Armament\" ) is used in some of Tartaglia's  Talent  and  Constellation  names, within the story, it exclusively refers to the form he takes on during the third phase of Enter the Golden House. [2] [5] [6] [7]   The description for  Childe: Foul Legacy  states that Foul Legacy ( Chinese :  魔王  \"Demon King\" ) is the name of Tartaglia and Skirk's fighting style, which combines many different fighting techniques. Notably, the original Chinese description removed the  武装  \"Armament\"  part used in other instances of \"Foul Legacy/Foul Legacy Transformation\" ( Chinese :  魔王武装 ).   Comparisons have been made between Tartaglia's  Elemental Skill  and  Elemental Burst , and the fighting style used by the  Abyss Order  enemy  Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents .   After Tartaglia unleashes Foul Legacy Transformation during Enter the Golden House, the English localization has him declare  \"Foul Legacy - The Devouring Deep!\"  However, the original Chinese text calls it  极恶法「鲸吞噬灭」   Jí'è-fǎ \"Jīngtūn-shìmiè\" , \"Extreme Evil Art 'Whale Swallowing Devouring Destruction'\" , a phrase which is equivalent to the \"Havoc\" ( Chinese :  极恶技   Jí'è-jì , \"Extreme Evil Technique\" ) used in Tartaglia's Elemental Burst,  Havoc: Obliteration , and his Constellations  Havoc: Formless Blade  and  Havoc: Annihilation .

A pair of them can be used by two parties or entities to be able to contact one another by speaking to the device with the audio coming off the other end. However, the number of times it can be used is limited. [1]   According to  Venti , only a select few have access to this device, with he and the Traveler being the only known users. However, when the Traveler and Paimon try to call him after being at the islands for a few days, an unknown voice answers instead and says that she cut off their connection to the outside world so that they can investigate the islands by themselves. [2]  The Traveler is able to call Venti again after the mystery of the islands is resolved, where he determines that she did not have any ill will. [3]   The inspiration for the Dodocommunication Device came from another world. [1]     Trivia [ ]   The voice that answered is implied to be the Dendro Archon,  Lesser Lord Kusanali .

This series serves as the basis of  Fischl 's persona.  Her vision of the Immernachtreich is reflected on the  Twinning Isle Mirage  during  Summertime Odyssey  and in Fischl's Mirage domains during  Immernachtreich Apokalypse , which narrate the story of  Hymn of the Holy Land .  This page encompasses the lore in  Flowers for Princess Fischl  as well as its depiction in  Hymn of the Holy Land , which is a reflection of Fischl's subconsciousness.

She seeks to revive her destroyed homeland, the Immernachtreich, [1]  and utilizes the power of darkness and dreams. [2]  She and Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, her retainer, are the World Beasts who swallows all dreams. At the end of the world, she will bless all the souls she has gathered, use Thundering Retribution to purge the evil and wicked, then finally set her own heart on fire to allow the universe to be reborn. [3]   Leon  also calls her the Soteria. [4]   In  Hymn of the Holy Land , it is stated that Fischl first descended on the world during the Time of Chaos, 600 years before the Era of the Saints. She has a great love of theater and, as such, theater is a big part of the Immernachtreich's culture. [2]   Ozvaldo (von) Hrafnavins:  Fischl's night raven retainer, also known as Prince Nachtraben. He is characterized by his undying loyalty to Fischl. Leon also calls him the Great Sekretär.   Kaiser der Verurteilung:   ( English :  Emperor of Condemnation ) Fischl's father. In  Flowers for Princess Fischl , he is described as \"mighty and majestic\" and helps Fischl through her confusions. [1]   Kaiserin der Verurteilung:   ( English :  Empress of Condemnation ) Fischl's mother and an enigmatic figure in the  Flowers for Princess Fischl  series. She has only one line in nearly all of her appearances: \"...The dream lives on.\" Towards the end of the series, as everything flows into the Immernachtreich, the full line is heard: \"Find meaning somewhere. The night deepens, but the dream lives on.\" [1]   Beast of the World:  Gesamtkunstwerk :  A World Beast which the Immernachtreich faces in certain probabilities. When Gesamtkunstwerk appears, other World Beasts from the center of the world will also appear. Its weakness is the Saint of Seven Tears. [1]   Saint of Seven Tears:  A character who appears in the final volume of  Flowers for Princess Fischl . [1]   Tasraque:  A wicked dragon who terrorizes the Immernachtreich in  Hymn of the Holy Land , whom Fischl eventually slays. After vanquishing it, she proclaims \"May my people be freed from the shackles of ancient decrees.\"  Mona  believes that \"Tasraque\" is a metaphor for the rejection Fischl faced from her parents and peers. [5]   Zarathustra:  A philosopher in the  Flowers for Princess Fischl  series. His role is unclear, but from context, it can be assumed that he normally gains control over the will of the world; in a distant causality, the opera writer — also called The Musician — gains control instead.   Terminology [ ]   Auge der Verurteilung:  In  Flowers for Princess Fischl , Fischl's left eye is capable of seeing all the truths of the world. She usually keeps it covered. [6]   Edelstein der Dunkelheit:  Fischl's name for her  Vision . [7] [8]   Garten Sansoucci:  Mentioned in Fischl's  Receiving a Gift: I  Voice-Over.  \"Sansoucci\" likely comes from the  Sanssouci  palace located in Germany. Sanssouci comes from French  sans souci  \"without worries\".   Mitternachtsbrot des Sommernachtgartens:  Mentioned in Fischl's  Favorite Food  Voice-Over.   Nachtraben Ritter:  The Night Raven Knights who have pledged their loyalty to Fischl. [2]   Sommernachtgarten:  Domains of consciousness which can be created by those skilled in magical arts. [1]   \"Sieh an, mein Sommernachtgarten!\" translates to \"Behold, my Summer Night Garden!\" and is the  track name  for Fischl's Character Teaser, as well as the password for the gate in  Immernachtreich Apokalypse (Part 3) .   Thundering Retribution:  The power by which Fischl cleanses the ugly and wicked. [3]   Trivia [ ]   Etymology [ ]   \"Soteria\" comes from the Ancient Greek word  σωτηρία   sōtēríā , meaning \"deliverance\" or \"salvation.\"   \"Tasraque\" comes from  Tarasque , a dragon-like mythological hybrid who appears in legends from southern France.

    "Archon_War": "Archon War     Type   Historical Events       The  Archon War  was an era of various power struggles between  gods  that began several thousand years ago for unknown reasons, although scholars in  Teyvat  believe it began over seven divine seats in  Celestia . [1]  While different regions settled their power struggles at different times, the era drew to a close 2,000 years ago after the final seat was claimed. [2]   With the end of an era came the establishment of a new order under the  Seven Archons . They established the seven nations, determining their method of governance through their ideals and shaping their nations using their elemental powers.    Contents     1   Overview   2   Mondstadt   3   Liyue   4   Inazuma   5   Sumeru   6   Fontaine   7   Natlan   8   Conclusion   9   Notes   10   Other Languages   11   References   12   Navigation       Overview [ ]   How or why the Archon War began is currently a mystery. Gods were able to coexist relatively peacefully before the War began, so the circumstances that triggered the Archon War are currently left to speculation. The logistics of the war are also unknown, such as how the nations were divided or how the victors were determined.  According to  Soraya , the war began as a struggle over the seven divine seats in  Celestia , [1]  both for supremacy and to see their plans for a prosperous humanity to come to fruition. [3]  However, not all gods participated in the war with the intent of taking a divine seat; some wanted to defend their territory, while others didn't even want to fight and tried to save as many people as possible from the destruction of the war.  An alternate explanation is that the death of gods  removed  divine seats that previously existed in Celestia, and The Seven were either gods who kept their seats by prevailing over the others, or were beings who ascended to godhood after defeating gods of old.  Decarabian 's death resulted in the \"crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity,\" while  Barbatos  ascended to godhood and became the Anemo Archon. [4]   Neuvillette , the reborn  Hydro Sovereign , recalled his predecessor's memory after the return of the Ancient Authority, that \"all fragments of the primordial were driven to devour each other.\" [5]  It is presumed that the aforementioned event is the Archon War, and the  Heavenly Principles  manipulated the gods to eliminate each other.  After The Seven were established, most defeated gods fled Teyvat and took refuge in the  Dark Sea  — lands outside of Teyvat where The Seven have no dominion, where they became known as \"evil gods.\" Some gods, however, chose to cooperate with The Seven and even became important figures, such as  Boreas .    Mondstadt [ ]   2600 years ago, in the midst of the Archon War, the city of  Mondstadt  was located northwest of the current location, what is now known as  Stormterror's Lair . Back then, there were two warring gods:  Decarabian , the God of Storms, and  Boreas , the King of the North Wind. The entity who would become  Barbatos  was but a wisp of the wind, with little to no power. [6]   At that time, Mondstadt was a wasteland of ice, snow, and endless icy blizzards, almost impossible for humans to live in. [7] [8]  This was all caused by Boreas, who gained his powers from an ancient — and likely deceased — god. [9]  In order to protect his people from the cold, Decarabian enclosed the city into a wall of storms, letting nothing go in or out of it; Boreas declared war on Decarabian, but was incapable of landing even a scratch on his tower. For his part, Decarabian seemed either uninterested in, or incapable of, defeating Boreas, and was content with keeping his people safe. Unbeknownst to Decarabian, however, his people felt trapped and worshipped him out of fear, which he mistook for genuine devotion. [Note 1]   During his time as a wisp of the wind, Barbatos befriended a  young bard  who dreamt of freedom. He also saved the  Gunnhildr Clan , who had left Decarabian's city to live in the frozen wasteland, and their resulting faith empowered him. [8]  Eventually, Barbatos and the Nameless Bard, alongside Decarabian's disillusioned lover  Amos  and an unnamed knight, raised an army against the God of Storms. [10]  They eventually emerged victorious, taking down the god and freeing the people from his stormy cage. Unfortunately, both Amos and the bard were among the casualties, causing deep regret for Barbatos.  After Decarabian's demise, Barbatos claimed a divine seat in Celestia, becoming the first — and only — Anemo Archon among The Seven. Boreas, despite holding tremendous power, was aware that he was ill-fit for the role of a loving archon who could nurture humanity, as he found human society to be a disappointment and only accepted abandoned infants and outcasts as his kin. [11] [12]  Believing himself unfit for the position of Anemo Archon, Boreas chose to disappear. [13]  In his final days, he realized that his icy blizzards could only destroy life and decided to let his power flow into the land of Mondstadt instead, putting an end to the icy storm. [14]  Boreas would eventually return as a spirit, watching over the area now known as  Wolvendom  and working with Barbatos as one of his  Four Winds .  Barbatos' first use of his powers was to take the form of the young bard as a way to honor him. [15]  After that, he used his wind powers to shape the land to make it prosperous for his people, teaching them the values of freedom. [4]  He then left the people to themselves, refusing to rule them directly and risk becoming a tyrant himself. [16]  Instead, he journeyed throughout Teyvat, often paying visits to the Geo Archon,  Morax , of the neighboring nation of Liyue. [17] [18]     Liyue [ ]   During the Archon War,  Morax , Deus Auri, and  Guizhong , the God of Dust, lived with the  adepti  and their people in the region now known as the  Guili Plains . When the war began, they stood by each other and fought other gods. 3,700 years ago, Guizhong died in a particular battle which also ravaged the Guili Plains, and Morax took the people south of  Mt. Tianheng  and established  Liyue Harbor . [19] [20]   After the establishment of  Liyue Harbor , Morax continued to defend his people from other gods and monsters. One of his exploits was the war with an unknown god in  Chenyu Vale . The war was implied to be particularly bloody, as the  Bishui River  was said to be crimson red. Morax easily overwhelmed the god, who then sought to flood the Bisuhi River in a final attempt to defeat him. This act would have also destroyed the vale, causing the god's adepti disciples,  Fujin  and the  Herblord , to defect. The two rebelled against their master, along with their old friend, the suanni  Lingyuan , to evacuate the people. The god's fate is unknown, but the Herblord fell in battle and Fujin \"sank to the sea,\" losing much of her powers in the process. [21]   Other notable feats of Morax were defeating and sealing various gods and sea monsters at  Guyun Stone Forest  with stone lances, among them were  Osial  and the  Chi  of Yore. Although they were defeated, the stone pillars became divine, but with hatred and curses within as well.  Marchosius , the God of the Stove, was one of the gods who sacrificed his power and godly status to prevent the calamities and plagues caused by the war from finally destroying Liyue. The demons that were generated, however, posed a threat to the people, so Morax assigned a group of adepti called the  Yaksha  to eliminate them. The karmic debt accumulated proved to be too much for them, either perishing or disappearing; as of the present day,  Xiao  is the only alive and active yaksha.  Among the gods who lost to Morax was the serpent god  Orobashi , who fled to  Inazuma  after its defeat. [22]   Meanwhile, the Salt Goddess  Havria , known for both her gentleness and relative weakness compared to other gods, tried to avoid the chaos of the Archon War and yearned for the peaceful days of old. However, in that brutal era, she found herself making more and more concessions until all she had left for her and her people was the land now known as  Sal Terrae . In the end, she perished at the hands of her own people: realizing that her love and kindness were incapable of protecting them, the king of her people decided to slay her both as a demonstration of their decision to take a more militaristic stance, [23]  and to spare her the agony of defeat and destruction at the hands of another god. On her death, however, the surge of power that emerged from her body turned anyone who had been in the area into salt. Those who survived were scattered throughout Liyue, most eventually settling in Liyue Harbor and forming  Yinyuan Hall  with a distorted version of events. [24]     Inazuma [ ]   Little information exists about the Archon War in  Inazuma . The Inazuman archipelago was united under the rule of the Electro Archon, the Raiden Shogun — which was  Makoto  (Baal), with her twin sister  Ei  (Beelzebul) serving as her  kagemusha . One of the gods they defeated was Orobashi who fled and found itself beyond the seal that separated  Enkanomiya  from the rest of Teyvat. [22]  Since then, it rescued the people there, brought them back to the surface, and created  Watatsumi Island  using its own scales for its people. Orobashi and the people of Watatsumi lived peacefully within the nation of Inazuma up until Orobashi's rebellion and death at the hands of the Shogun. [25] [26] [Note 2]     Sumeru [ ]   Unlike other nations, the three God-Kings:  King Deshret ,  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata , and  Nabu Malikata  peacefully shared the throne with each other [27] [Note 3] . King Deshret even went so far as to reject the position of Archon (with  Gnosis  and/or the Dragon Authority implicitly referred to as a \"gift\" given to him by Celestia) to pursue his own interests and ambitions. [28]  Multiple events subsequently led to the deaths of King Deshret and the Goddess of Flowers, [Note 4]  and Rukkhadevata thus was titled as the sole Archon of Sumeru, though she did not actively rule over Deshret's former lands in the  Great Red Sand , and the people of the desert never acknowledged her as their god [29] . The remainder of the Archon War period instead saw internecine conflicts between rival human city states in Sumeru's desert [30] , and the slow decline of Nabu Malikata's children, the jinn. [31]  Ultimately, the conflicts in the Great Red Sand came to a close with the founding of  Aaru Village  in the eastern mountains and the foreswearing of human kings. [32]  After  Lesser Lord Kusanali  erased Rukkhadevata from the Irminsul, the world now knew Kusanali as the Dendro Archon that arose from the Archon War. [33]     Fontaine [ ]   Little evidence of the Archon War is known in Fontaine, though it likely coincided with  Remuria 's conquest of Fontaine. At this time,  Egeria  had been sealed away by Celestia for using Primordial Seawater to give human forms to the Oceanids. Meanwhile, the God King  Remus , who created and ruled over the ancient civilization of Remuria, had desperately sought a way to avert the  prophecy  wrought on by Egeria's actions. In his attempts to bring all of Fontaine under his rule and thereby save everyone, Remus began a vicious campaign of conquest against the other tribes of Fontaine, whom he would either convince to join him or take by force. [34]  Remuria was led into destruction by its own creation,  Phobos , as Remus and  Scylla 's plan to stop Phobos failed, which resulted in Remus's death, Scylla's imprisonment, and Remuria's sinking into the  Sea of Bygone Eras . [35]  Celestia commanded Egeria to return from the \" primeval prison \" they had trapped her in and take over Remus' position in ruling Fontaine. [36]   After ascending as the Hydro Archon and cementing her rule, Egeria exiled all of the nation's criminals, who were treated as outcasts. Some of these criminals repented and begged for mercy, which she heard and granted by having them \"protect\" her  secret in the depths , which they did by constructing the  Fortress of Meropide .    Natlan [ ]   The battle between  Xbalanque  and the dragon  Xiuhcoatl  likely took place during the Archon War. Xbalanque emerged victorious, and, after becoming the first Pyro Archon, [37] [38]  founded the unique rules and system of Natlan, borrowing the power of the heavens after his ascension to the divine throne. [38]     Conclusion [ ]   As the Archon War drew to a close 2,000 years ago, [2]  only the Seven remained, giving Teyvat the seven nations we know today.  Only Barbatos and Morax remain as the original victors of the Archon War, while the other five nations' Archons have been replaced over the past 2,000 years:    Baal  died 500 years ago in the cataclysm and was been replaced by her twin sister, named  Beelzebul , under the name \"Baal\".   Similarly, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata also died 500 years ago in the cataclysm and has been replaced by her incarnation in the next samsara,  Buer .   The previous Hydro Archon -  Egeria  - perished during the cataclysm, and her remains became the  Amrita Pool  while her consciousness was anchored to the Human Realm by the  Harvisptokhm  (grown by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata) to contain and cleanse the abyssal defilement in the  Girdle of the Sands , she was later succeeded by one of her familiars  Focalors  as the new Hydro Archon.   Unlike other Archons, Xbalanque and his successors retained human lifespans after their ascension, with the title of Pyro Archon being passed down to many humans over the years. The last of these was  Mavuika , who was able to enjoy a longer lifespan after putting her life into the  Sacred Flame .   After Nahida purged Rukkhadevata from the Irminsul, the world's perception was changed and Nahida was now known as the only Dendro Archon since the Archon War.  Zhongli 's altered Character Story 5 now indicated that he and Barbatos were the only two of the first Seven to remain  in positions of rulership . This supposes that Buer lost the ruler position due to her amnesia after exhausting her power during the cataclysm, and only regained her position recently. Thus, she is not viewed the same as Zhongli and Venti.    Notes [ ]     ↑   While the idea that Decarabian trapped his people within the city is often stated in Mondstadt's history books, this is contradicted by  Biography of Gunnhildr , which claims that the Gunnhildr Clan took refuge in the city, then left after growing disillusioned by Decarabian's rule. It is possible that the people's dissatisfaction with his rule originated from his apparent inaction against Boreas, who turned the rest of Mondstadt into a frozen tundra. Over time this discontentment morphed into the belief that Decarabian was a tyrant who locked them within his city without cause.     ↑   Sangonomiya Chronicles states that Orobashi peacefully lived under the Electro Archon's rule, and  Those Who Yearn for the Gods' Gaze  states that Orobashi invaded  Yashiori Island  and was killed there during the Archon War. Assuming both statements are true, Makoto may have become Electro Archon before the Archon War officially ended 2000 years ago, and then Orobashi attacked Yashiori Island at some point between their victory and the Archon War's official end.     ↑   There appear to be no other gods besides the three of them, as Remus left Sumeru long before the Archon War.     ↑   The death of Nabu Malikata and later, King Deshret, were stated to happen \"thousands of years ago\", according to  Nahida . It is likely that they died during the Archon War period, leaving Greater Lord Rukkhadevata as the sole god.

    "Cataclysm": "Cataclysm           The  Traveler's Sibling  (depicted: Lumine) witnesses Khaenri'ah's destruction       Type   Historical Events       The  cataclysm  ( Chinese :  灾祸   zāihuò , \"disaster\" ), [1] [2]  also referred to by a myriad of other descriptions including the  catastrophe , the  disaster , [3]  the  fall of  Khaenri'ah  (or the \"ancient kingdom\"), [4]  the  Dark Calamity  or  the Calamity of Darkness , [5]  and the  pitch-black calamity , [6] [Note 1]  refers to a period of widespread chaos and destruction which occurred five hundred years ago.  The conflicts surrounding the cataclysm primarily revolve around the encroachment of the  Abyss  — an otherworldly power at odds with  Celestia 's power — and the destruction of  Khaenri'ah , a nation that lived without the influence of the  gods . While the exact order of events is unknown, monsters carrying Abyssal power spewed forth from Khaenri'ah and wreaked havoc throughout  Teyvat . Khaenri'ah's attempt to rebel against the gods ended with its destruction at the hands of the gods and the Heavenly Principles. This led survivors from the fallen nation to bear grudges against Celestia and the  Seven Archons , while The Seven themselves grew embittered towards Celestia. Two of the Teyvat Chapter's main antagonistic groups, the  Abyss Order  and the  Fatui , were established as a direct response to Celestia's actions. [7] [8]   The exact circumstances surrounding the cataclysm remain a mystery, but it is linked to the \"truth of this world.\" The  Traveler 's journey is to uncover said truth, during which they will learn more about the cataclysm.      Note:  Because the  Genshin Impact  story has deliberately left information surrounding the cataclysm vague, this page contains information that is confirmed to be about the cataclysm as well as information that is suggested, but not confirmed, to be about the cataclysm.  References are provided as much as possible. Notes expand on the deduction and reasoning used to draw certain conclusions, which can be read either by hovering over (desktop-only) or clicking on the note. Some specific types of notes found on the page:    Lore Discrepancy:  When information provided in the game is self-contradictory, retroactively changed, or contradicts information from outside media (such as the  manga ), it is considered a lore discrepancy. This is different from a translation discrepancy, in which information is contradictory or misleading due to inaccuracies in localization. In the case of a lore discrepancy between in-game information and outside media, the in-game information always takes priority.   Translation Note:  Used when the original Chinese text and then official English localization do not match, or if something is clearer in Chinese. In the case of a translation discrepancy, the original Chinese text always takes priority.   Assumptions:  To make sense of the lore — which the  miHoYo  writers often deliberately obscure by withholding critical information until later versions, giving contradictory evidence, and scattering information across various item sets — editors will sometimes make assumptions to determine the order of events or connect pieces of lore together. However, they may be obsoleted and proven incorrect by new lore and story. These notes serve as a disclaimer, and expand on the editors' reasoning for their conclusions.

Khaenri'ah's Ambition [ ]   Several thousand years ago, around the time the ancient civilization  Sal Vindagnyr  fell, [9] [Assumption 1]  the kingdom of Khaenri'ah was established as a nation without gods and its inhabitants considered their nation to be the \"pride of humankind.\" [10]  Khaenri'ah's existence and its goal of living independently from the gods were not secrets in Teyvat, [9] [11]  and people from the Seven Nations have joined the original founders of Khaenri'ah over the millennia. [12]   People of Khaenri'ah suspected that the so-called \"gods\" — and in particular the entity known as the  Heavenly Principles  — were in fact alien to this world and had usurped it from its original denizens. [13]  They knew the rumor that  \"the [starry] skies of Teyvat are fake\" [14] [15] [Translation Note 1]  — which was completely unknown to the second God of Wisdom  Lesser Lord Kusanali  before she learned of it from  Il Dottore  during the events of  Archon Quest   Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies  in  Chapter III : Act V -  Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises . Khaenri'ah began plotting to rebel against and overthrow the gods. [7]  They developed  Automatons  now known as Ruin Machines as a means to fight against Celestia, and originally knew \" Ruin Guards \" as \"Field Tillers,\" as they believed that  \"The land is not to be tilled with farming tools, but rather to be fought for with steel and blood.\" [10]   Few Khaenri'ahn statements have emerged regarding their perspective on the  Archon War , which led to the establishment of  The Seven . However, they had some notable activities during that time period.  Ruin Machines  appeared in Teyvat as early as 3,700 years ago and some were collected by  Guizhong  during her research into mechanics. [16] [Assumption 2]  Shortly before the last people in  Enkanomiya  emigrated to  Watatsumi Island , diplomats from Khaenri'ah traveled to Enkanomiya to find evidence that the gods were usurpers. They attempted to steal the forbidden book  Before Sun and Moon , which held an account of the ancient world ruled by the  Primordial One  up until its clash with the  Second Who Came , but failed to make away with it due to  Antei 's intervention. [17] [18]   It is unclear why the gods never made a move against Khaenri'ah over its long history, but it is heavily implied that Celestia finally took action 500 years ago due to Khaenri'ah's increasing involvement with the  Abyss  and forbidden knowledge, which are inherently corruptive towards Teyvat.    The Abyss and Forbidden Knowledge [ ]   The Abyss' power is described as \"alien\" to the world of Teyvat and is the only power capable of tainting the power of the gods. [19]  Forbidden knowledge, which stems from the depths of the Abyss, cannot be understood by even the Gods of Wisdom themselves, and its effects on mortals are both dangerous and maddening — capable of driving them insane and manifesting as deadly diseases such as  Eleazar . The world itself appears to decay and die under its influence as evidenced by the  Withering . If forbidden knowledge is not eradicated completely, even traces of it would continue to forever plague the world. [15]   The first presumed emergence of Abyssal power in Teyvat occurred during the war between the Heavenly Principles and the Second Who Came.  Nabu Malikata , a survivor of the  Seelie  race — which had once been heavenly envoys tasked with guiding humanity — recounted to  King Deshret  how \"'invaders descended from beyond the firmament, bringing with them destruction, overturning rivers, spreading plagues,'\" and that these invaders not only brought war to the Seelie but also vainly attempted to break the \"shackles\" to the land. [20] [Translation Note 2]  Afterwards, the Heavenly Principles cast down the  divine nails  to mend the earth, which also laid waste to the mortal realm. [21]  This roughly aligns with the timeline of Sal Vindagnyr's destruction, which in turn indicates that the kingdom of Khaenri'ah formed around this time period.  The \"shackles\" may include one or all of the \"cycle of seven;\" \"sun, moon, and weight;\" \"barrier between life and death;\" and/or the \"original principles of rules, verdicts, and grace.\" King Deshret mentions that the \"dark poison penetrated the earth,\" wherein the \"dark poison\" refers to Abyssal power, and goes on to state  \"The beastly trail from the poison should be cut off, for taking poison is a sin running deeper than the sky. But how sweet the whispers can be, and how clear the wisdom of which they speak...\"  Hoping to overthrow the Heavenly Principles himself, King Deshret later inadvertently spread forbidden knowledge, bringing his kingdom to ruin. [22]   In  Sumeru , which Khaenri'ah was located underneath, [23]  another four notable incidents involving the Abyss and/or forbidden knowledge have occurred. While the first two incidents have no direct relation to Khaenri'ah or the cataclysm, they illustrate the destructiveness of Abyssal power to Teyvat:    Thousands of years ago, as the final part of her vengeance against  Ormazd ,  Liloupar  ultimately utilized the power of the Abyss to wreak havoc in the oasis kingdom.  Parvezravan  and many of the city's inhabitants turned into monsters, while the capital city fell into a deep chasm within the earth. [24]  A plague also overran the city and devastated the population. [25]   Before Liloupar's incident, Nabu Malikata sacrificed herself to help King Deshret learn the secrets of the skies and the Abyss to further his ambition of making humanity into the \"god of gods.\" [26] [27]  This caused the land to be engulfed by a sandstorm and while King Deshret survived, his continued attempts to turn humanity into the \"god of gods\" eventually brought forbidden knowledge to his people sometime after Liloupar's incident. This knowledge brought forth the demise of his once-glorious desert civilization, filling the minds of his people with \"crazed whispers\" and causing dark necrotic scales to manifest on their bodies. It is implied that the land itself would have withered away were it not for the timely intervention of  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata , who built temples infused with the divine power of life to slow down the spread of the blight. This threat was only completely eradicated after King Deshret chose to sacrifice himself, purging forbidden knowledge from the world for good. [22] [28]   During the cataclysm, another resurgence of Abyssal power and forbidden knowledge occurred. This time, the disaster was so severe that it brought ruin to the rainforest and infected  Irminsul  itself — and by extension, the consciousness of the  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata , who was the avatar of Irminsul. While the Dendro Archon gave her life trying to combat the knowledge pollution, she could only stall its progression as traces of it yet remained in her corrupted conscious in Irminsul, creating Withering Zones, causing Eleazar, and even triggering earthquakes and sandstorms in the desert for the next 500 years. During  Archon Quest   Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies  in  Chapter III : Act V -  Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises ,  Lesser Lord Kusanali  erases the remnant memory of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata in Irminsul, which successfully eradicates the knowledge pollution — but comes at the cost of the entire world of Teyvat forgetting that Rukkhadevata ever existed. The only known person known to remember Rukkhadevata afterwards is the  Traveler , who lies outside of Teyvat's laws. [15]   During the cataclysm, the area known as the  Girdle of the Sands  was greatly affected by the Abyss, with the  Pari , a sprite-like race, having to fight against the corruption alongside the  Nagarjunites . While a great tree sprouted in  Vourukasha Oasis  unleashing pure energy, at  Tunigi Hollow , a current of Abyssal energy flowed through it, resulting in both sides being in a deadlock in past 500 years. The tree was nearing the verge of collapse until the Traveler intervened, removing the abyssal power and cleansing the tree with the help of the Pari.   The Art of Khemia [ ]   The  Art of Khemia , a form of  alchemy  developed in Khaenri'ah that allows for the creation of life itself, has also been hinted as a cause for Khaenri'ah's destruction. [29]  Because Khaenri'ah was established underground and therefore had few natural fauna, the Art of Khemia was developed as a means to create life for the sake of survivability. [30]  It is unclear whether the Art of Khemia was originally developed with the Abyss' power, but it certainly was by the time of the cataclysm.  After Khaenri'ah fell, the alchemist \"Gold\"  Rhinedottir [31]  became a \"sinner\" and created an \"army of shadowy monsters\" that included the dark dragon  Durin . [4]  These creations, empowered by an \"all-consuming darkness\" capable of tainting even the powers of The Seven, destroyed all in their path once they were unleashed on Teyvat. [19]  Rhinedottir's motivations for unleashing her creations and causing widespread destruction is unknown and some of them, such as the  Rifthounds , appear to have run free on their own. Durin was under the impression that she sent him aboveground to display his \"beauty,\" [32]  and was unconscious of his actions and the destruction he caused once he reached  Mondstadt  up until the moment of his death. [33]     The Arrival of Outlanders [ ]   As part of their ambition to overthrow the Heavenly Principles, the sages of Khaenri'ah took an interest in the Abyss, believing that so long as they could control the Abyss, they could control \"everything.\" [34] [Translation Note 3]  Sometime around 500 years ago, the  Traveler's sibling  descended on this world after the \"heavens [Sky] responded to the summoning,\" [35] [Translation Note 4]  and traveled to Khaenri'ah first. [36]   The Khaenri'ahns placed their hopes in the Traveler's sibling, seeing them as someone who represented the Abyss and would bring \"new strength and hope\" to them. They became the \"Prince\"/\"Princess\" of Khaenri'ah [34]  and Pierro is said to have lived with them for a time. [35]  However, the sibling's involvement became a catalyst for the cataclysm instead, something  Chlothar Alberich  berated them for when they met after Khaenri'ah fell. [34]   Notably, even though both the  Traveler  and their sibling descended to this world after having traveled to countless worlds following the destruction of their home world, [37]  the sibling's activities in this world were recorded in  Irminsul , which only contains records of those native to this world. This has led the  Fatui  not to consider the sibling as a  Descender  when the Traveler is, and  Lesser Lord Kusanali  suggests that the sibling is actually native to this world despite the Traveler's memories indicating that this is not possible. [36]  Scaramouche later posits that Khaenri'ah has something to do with this discrepancy, and his speculation is informed by the information given to him by the former Khaenri'ahn royal mage  Pierro . [35]   The Fatui have recorded at least four Descenders, the first of which Lesser Lord Kusanali presumes is the Heavenly Principles, who aligns with the Primordial One (or the \"eternal throne of the heavens\") mentioned in  Before Sun and Moon , [38]  and the fourth of which is the Traveler. [36]  It can be assumed from  Before Sun and Moon  and from Nabu Malikata's account that the second Descender is likely the entity known as the Second Who Came (or \"second throne of the heavens\"), [38]  who may also be the outlander whom a Seelie ancestor fell in love with — which led to the destruction of heaven and earth merely thirty days after their union. [39]   Also noteworthy is that when the traveling twins attempted to leave Teyvat, the  Unknown God  who introduced herself as the \"sustainer of Heavenly Principles\" calls the twins \"outlanders\" when she confronts them, indicating that she knew they both were not from this world. She also seemed to be specifically targeting the sibling; after capturing the sibling, she merely gazes at the sibling's cube in her hand and pays no heed to the Traveler up until they attempt to attack her. [40]  How or why the sibling gained the freedom to wander Teyvat after their presumed capture, when the Traveler was not freed for another 500 years, has yet to be seen.    Celestia's Punishment [ ]   Two concepts closely associated with Celestia have been brought up regarding Khaenri'ah's destruction: sin and the  Heavenly Principles  (also referred to as \"destiny\"). Based on lore surrounding  Orobashi  and the people of  Enkanomiya , \"sin\" consists of both knowledge and actions deemed subversive in Celestia's eyes. [13]  The exact nature of the Heavenly Principles is a mystery, but it seems to be linked to the concepts of the relentless flow of time and the impermanence of the mortal realm.  Pierro , who co-founded the  Fatui  with the  Cryo Archon  after the cataclysm, mentions that the \"sages\" from his home country — Khaenri'ah [35]  — tore away the \"veil of sin,\" thereby \"ushering in a tide of divine wrath, destruction, and foolishness.\" [41]  People of Khaenri'ah have been referred to as \"sinners,\" both by Khaenri'ahns in reference to themselves [42]  and in other sources.  Kaeya  remarks that all that is left in Khaenri'ah are sinners who \"aren't worth talking about, Rhinedottir (as Gold) is described as a \"sinner\" [4] [43] [Note 2]  and \"great sinner.\" [19]   While Khaenri'ah's sins have not been explicitly stated, Enkanomiya may provide enough information to make some hypotheses. For holding an account of the ancient world in  Before Sun and Moon , which was written by a scribe of  Istaroth  and later inadvertently read by Orobashi, all of Watatsumi was pronounced guilty with \"four counts of the sin of profanity, and a further eight counts for the sin of deceiving living souls.\" [13] [44]  To prevent its people from being collectively punished, Orobashi agreed to take their sins on itself and go to its death to pay the price, and banned the book. Shortly before revealing himself to be an Abyss Lector and attacking the  Traveler , Enjou tells them that he is \"one such sinner — one who has committed the sins of deception and betrayal.\" [13]   The Heavenly Principles, meanwhile, are something both  The Seven  and the Abyss Order view in a negative light. While recounting the events of the cataclysm and how they led to her current obsession with Eternity,  Ei  says she saw \"a nation stride forward and lose everything to the Heavenly Principles.\" [45]  After the remains of  Makoto 's power is used to plant the  Sacred Sakura  in the past, Makoto says:  Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within. When both shine in unison, the Sacred Sakura blooms from the darkness, finally free from the clutches of the Heavenly Principles.  Furthermore, Ei's dialogue afterward suggests that Istaroth had a hand in Makoto's ability too. [46]   Several other figures have voiced their opinion that Celestia's punishment of Khaenri'ah was cruel and unjust. It is the reason why the  Traveler's Sibling  seeks to wage endless war against \"destiny\" until the \"thrones\" are toppled, and why the  Tsaritsa  seeks to rebel against the divine and create a new world. [47] [48]  To oppose both the Abyss Order and Celestia, the Tsaritsa established the Fatui, with Pierro as its first member.  At the same time, Celestia's attack may have been triggered by Khaenri'ah's actions. Dainsleif warns the Traveler against \"trying to overthrow them [the gods], or hunt[ing] them down,\" despite previously voicing his disdain towards them. When the Traveler questions his contradictory statements, he explains that he wants to avoid repeating the \"failings of my forebears.\" [7]  Pierro's statement about how the sages of his nation \"ushered in\" the destruction wrought on them suggests he believes they had some culpability in causing their own destruction. [41]  While musing to himself before  La Signora 's funeral, he alludes to these same sages, saying \"The sages think themselves to be all-knowing, but we [the Fatui] alone are wise to the virtue in those acts of folly.\" [48] [Note 3]     Other Potential Causes [ ]   While his exact deeds are a mystery, the  kitsune   Urakusai  is believed to have had some involvement in the Abyss' attack during the cataclysm. After discovering what he had done, the  Kitsune Saiguu  angrily banished him to parts unknown, then moved to  Tenshukaku  in preparation for the Abyss' attack. [49]     The Cataclysm in Teyvat [ ]   Mondstadt [ ]   After monsters began emerging from Khaenri'ah, the  Knights of Favonius , led by Grand Master  Arundolyn  and his anticipated successor  Rostam , went on an expedition to Khaenri'ah to fight the monsters. [50]  Rostam died during the expedition, leaving Arundolyn and  Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter , who was studying at  Sumeru Akademiya  when he died, greatly bereaved. Arundolyn gave up fighting and retired from the Knights of Favonius out of grief, [51]  while Rosalyne used her knowledge to transform her body into that of living flame and enact her vengeance against the monsters, becoming known as the \"Crimson Witch of Flames.\" [52]   Meanwhile, Mondstadt was attacked by a corrupted  Durin , who was created [31] [53]  and sent to Teyvat by  Rhinedottir . [19] [32] [43] [54] [54] [55] [56]  As Arundolyn had given up fighting after Rostam's death, there was no Lionfang Knight to lead in battle and no one strong enough to take on Durin. [51] [55] [57] [58] [59]  The people of Mondstadt cried out for help and were heard by the  Anemo Archon , who called upon Dvalin. The two engaged Durin in battle and eventually defeated him.  Dvalin ingested Durin's poisonous blood in the process and went to  Old Mondstadt  to recover [43] [54] [55] [56] [60]  while Durin fell down on  Dragonspine , whose extreme, unnatural cold allowed the power inside Durin to seep into the land of Dragonspine. Even today, Durin's heart in  Wyrmrest Valley  appears to still beat. [33]     Liyue [ ]   In Liyue,  The Chasm  and  Dunyu Ruins  are two known locations majorly impacted by the cataclysm. Monsters poured out of the Chasm and in response,  Morax  sent the  Millelith  to defend and evacuate the miners. The  yaksha   Bosacius , who had once abandoned his duty to defend Liyue after going mad from  karma , was drawn to the bloodshed and fought alongside the Millelith. Bosacius, the exorcist  Boyang , and some of the Millelith who chose to lead the vanguard ultimately perished in The Chasm after luring the monsters into a mysterious underground palace with the power to negate the power of the Abyss and using the  Fantastic Compass  to seal them in the  Chasm's Bed . [61] [62]  Liyue eventually won the battle, but at the cost of many lives. [63]   What occurred in Dunyu Ruins is unknown, but its people decided to abandon the city and move to Liyue Harbor; none of the refugees nor adepti have spoken about what happened there. [64]     Inazuma [ ]   Shortly before the Abyss invaded Teyvat, the  kitsune   Urakusai  apparently did something linked to it, which greatly angered the  Kitsune Saiguu  and led to his banishment. The Kitsune Saiguu, aware of the impending threat, moved from the  Grand Narukami Shrine  to  Tenshukaku  to stay close to the Electro Archon, then  Makoto . [49]  Makoto was also aware that something was going to happen in Khaenri'ah, saying that it \"was not somewhere that any archon could afford to ignore\" after Ei asks her about it long after her death. [46]   When the Abyss attacked, Makoto and her close allies,  Ei ,  Mikoshi Chiyo , the Kitsune Saiguu,  Reizenbou , and  Takamine the Mistsplitter  fought back the otherworldly threat but eventually perished or disappeared. Chiyo was consumed by a \"beast of sin\" and, while she slew the monster from within, was corrupted — she turned against Ei and fought her, which ended after Ei cut her horns and sword arm off and forced her to flee. The Kitsune Saiguu disappeared and was \"consumed\" by the Abyss for reasons that are unclear but likely related to the  Thunder Sakuras , which were nearly overwhelmed trying to purify the land during the cataclysm. Reizenbou, enraged by her inability to protect the Kitsune Saiguu, left on a self-imposed exile. Takamine disappeared in a battle against the dark forces, only to be killed by his former lover  Asase Hibiki  when he finally resurfaced many years later. [65]  Makoto was slain in battle in what is suggested to be Khaenri'ah, dying in her sister's arms. [45]     Sumeru [ ]   Sumeru was apparently affected by the cataclysm later than other countries such as Mondstadt, [66] [67]  and it occurred simultaneously with the contamination of  Irminsul  by the forbidden knowledge. It's not known if the two events are connected, however, the Dendro Archon,  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata , was slain during the cataclysm, which caused  Viridescent  to no longer be able to hear the grass and trees speak. [68]   Old Vanarana  was one of the places attacked in Sumeru by hordes of ruin machines and riftwolves. While the  Aranara  fought fiercely against the invaders, presumably with some humans, the land itself was heavily scarred from the fighting. A strange entity known as  Marana's Avatar  quickly formed at some point during or after the battle. While the Aranara managed to seal it away, it eventually managed to bypass the seal and began to spread an anomaly later known as  The Withering  across Sumeru's forests.  In the Girdle of the Sands, monsters also emerged from the Abyss to attack the area, with the Pari and Nagarjunites working together to repel the threat; the previous Hydro Archon,  Egeria , was slain in battle, but Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the  Harvisptokhm  to tether her consciousness to the mortal realm and contain the Abyssal defilement in the area. Several monsters were also encased in a strange gray crystal that resulted from the powers of the Abyss, leaving them in a state of torpor for the next few centuries. As centuries passed, the Harvisptokhm began to degrade and without anyone to maintain it, it was nearly overwhelmed by the defilement until the Traveler and a Pari named  Sorush  discovered the remaining Great Songs of Khvarena to purify the crystallized trees at Tunigi Hollow.    Fontaine [ ]   It is implied that  Elynas  appeared at some point during the cataclysm, and began to cause severe pollution to the land and sea. The Director of the  Narzissenkreuz Institute  and other  Oceanid  went to confront the disaster, while vice-director  Basil Elton  was recalled by the Fontaine Armada to hunt Elynas. The armada was nearly destroyed while hunting Elynas down, as they attracted many abyssal sea creatures during their pursuit, with the  Sponsian  being destroyed in battle against Elynas. Elynas eventually bled out and died.    Natlan [ ]   During the Cataclysm, Natlan was particularly vulnerable to the threat of the Abyss as they had the most unstable and shallow-rooted Ley Lines on Teyvat. This corruption caused immense damage and its people initially resigned themselves to their fate, believing victory was impossible. However, with the  Pyro Archon  leading the way and uniting the tribes, they were able to repel the Abyss from their nation, albeit at a high cost, forcing the Abyss to retreat underground where they remain a threat to the nation until this day. [69]   Under the Pyro Archon's order,  Tenoch , along with the six heroes from the six major tribes, headed first into the hotspot of Abyss emergence, at the place later known as  Mare Jivari  at the west of Natlan. [70] [71]   When the Abyss invaded the Children of Echoes, the hero  Traore  and the tribesfolk, with the help of the two Khaenri'ahn soldiers  Zephaniah  and  Irizar , managed to lure it to the  Sulfurous Veins  and sealed it with numerous Shadow Pins. [72] [73]     The Cataclysm in Khaenri'ah [ ]   The clash between Celestia and The Seven versus Khaenri'ah ended with the gods' victory. As punishment for losing, the  Eclipse Dynasty  was wiped out. Dainsleif, a knight of the royal family, as well as all pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were cursed with immortality, while citizens of Khaenri'ah who were half-blood or belonging to other nations entirely were instead inflicted with a curse that transformed them into monsters and hilichurls. [74] [75]  Some people appear to have avoided the curse, such as  Kaeya , and ostensibly  Rhinedottir , but their exact circumstances are unknown. Kaeya's circumstances are of particular note because several of his ancestors,  Chlothar  and  Caribert , were afflicted with the curse, perhaps suggesting that it was broken at some point, allowing the remainder of Kaeya's lineage to escape its effects. Some, like Dainsleif, have some unknown means of retaining their sanity, although it merely mitigates the effects of their curses.  During the disaster, Dainsleif orders  Halfdan , an elite of the Royal Guards to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs. However, Halfdan and the other royal guards ended up transforming into  Shadowy Husks . Despite this, Halfdan was able to retain part of his consciousness despite lacking whatever Dainsleif used to mitigate his own curse. [75]   Capitano  and his men initially fought during the cataclysm, but when he realized that the situation was unsalvageable, he ordered a retreat to Natlan.  Paimon  also concludes from the account given by the Traveler's Sibling that the monsters of the Abyss Order were originally the people of Khaenri'ah, [74]  which appears to be supported by the Pyro Abyss Lector  Enjou 's search for  Before Sun and Moon , mirroring the Khaenri'ah delegation's search from at least 2,000 years ago. As a result of the curse, Dainsleif no longer views hilichurls or Abyss monsters as human. [10] [75]  It is still unclear what the suggested link between the hilichurls' Eclipse Tribe and Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty [76]  means.  After the Traveling Twins arrived in Teyvat, Traveler's Sibling awoke first and eventually bore witness to Khaenri'ah's destruction. [77]  After the cataclysm, they journeyed through the seven nations of Teyvat alongside  Dainsleif . [36] [74]     Aftermath [ ]           The traveling twins fight the Unknown God       Across the world, there was a sudden surge in hilichurl population following the cataclysm. [6] [78]     Khaenri'ah [ ]   With Khaenri'ah in ruins, the Traveler's Sibling rushed back to where the Traveler still lay unconscious and woke them up, hoping to leave Teyvat as quickly as possible. The Traveler briefly witnessed the destroyed nation themselves before the two eventually set foot in Celestia as they attempted to leave. [Assumption 3]  There, they were confronted by the Unknown God, who easily overpowered them and separated them, sealing the Sibling away first before dealing with the Traveler. [40]   Without their masters, Khaenri'ah's automatons spread all over Teyvat, becoming particularly drawn to ruins and thereby becoming known as Ruin Machines. [10]  The Abyss Order was formed with the intent of overthrowing Celestia and laying waste to the surface world under their dominion. [74]  Meanwhile, despite his anger towards The Seven, Dainsleif viewed the Abyss Order as the greater threat and became their vehement opponent. [10]  Pierro, who had opposed the sages' plan from the start, sided with the Tsaritsa and her objective of creating a \"new world,\" becoming the Director of the Fatui Harbingers. Capitano would later follow suit, becoming the first of the Fatui Harbingers. The  Alberich Clan  stepped up as regents after the King  Irmin 's strength failed, although they were unable to revive Khaenri'ah. [79]   Not only did Rhinedottir emerge from the cataclysm alive, she went on to create her second masterpiece, the synthetic human  Albedo . When questioned about his link to the fallen nation, Albedo reassures the Traveler that he was created long after its destruction and that, as a \"pure alchemist\" like Rhinedottir who lives for academic knowledge, he has no particular attachment to it. [31]  Whether this reflects Rhinedottir's opinion on Khaenri'ah has yet to be seen.    Mondstadt [ ]   Rosalyne continued fighting against monsters, but her indiscriminate destruction caused many to become fearful of her. Before her flames could consume her heart and kill her, she was discovered by Pierro, who gave her a  Delusion  to suppress the flames and a psychological \"delusion\" that swayed her to join the Fatui's cause.  The White Knight Rostam mentored [57]  survived the expedition and continued fighting against monsters. However, he became engrossed with the physical sensation of slaughter and became known as the  Bloodstained Knight . Realizing he no longer had a place amongst humanity, he ventured into the Abyss intending to die in battle, only to learn about their origins: the \"ultimate injustice\" that cursed the people of Khaenri'ah into transforming into monsters. The Bloodstained Knight then pledged his allegiance to the Abyss, and his fate thereafter is unknown. [80] [81]   At some point in Mondstadt's history, the first  Field Tiller  — a prototype for the automatons now known as Ruin Guards — somehow ended up in Mondstadt and wandered into  Boreas ' proving ground. Initially mistaking the war machine for a challenger, Boreas fought against it and eventually greatly damaged it. It then fled to  Decarabian 's tower, where it proceeded to fire missiles at anyone who approached the area. The people of Mondstadt, who did not know about Khaenri'ah's advanced technology, mistook these attacks as the vestiges of Decarabian's wrath and entitled the phenomenon \"The Tyrant's Final Fury.\" However, around a year after the attacks began, they suddenly ceased as the Field Tiller lost functionality. People thereafter determined it was likely not Decarabian's doing, as he was the God of Storms and was unlikely to use fire-based attacks, but did not investigate the issue further. [7]     Liyue [ ]   In Liyue, the battle against monsters led to a renaissance in weaponsmithing and catalyst creation after people discovered the weapons up until the cataclysm were not suitable for combat against such creatures. [82] [83]  This renaissance continued even after the end of the monster onslaught and led to the development of the  Prototype Series  and  Blackcliff Series  weapons.    Inazuma [ ]   With Makoto's death, Ei became the new Electro Archon. Having lost many of her close allies over the course of the conflict, and fearful after witnessing her sister's death and \"that thing,\" [84]  Ei became fixated on Eternity and hoped to preserve the current Inazuma forever. Disillusioned with Celestia after witnessing Khaenri'ah's fate, [45]  she severed ties with Celestia and ultimately gave her  Gnosis  to  Yae Miko  for safekeeping. [85]   Afraid that she was susceptible to  erosion , Ei conducted experiments into creating an automaton in her likeness, which would rule Inazuma in her stead while Ei would isolate herself in her personal world, the  Plane of Euthymia , meditating to stave off erosion. In the process of creating  the Shogun , Ei also created the puppet now known as  Scaramouche . [86]     Sumeru [ ]   Following Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death,  Lesser Lord Kusanali  was born and became the new Dendro Archon. [87]  The Akasha System, which is powered by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's Gnosis, is currently used by the people of Sumeru to manage knowledge as a resource. [88]  While the Akasha System is described as Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's legacy, using knowledge as a resource is apparently not something they thought of themselves, as Yae Miko ponders whether it was Lesser Lord Kusanali or the sages at  Sumeru Akademiya  who came up with the idea. [85]     Fontaine [ ]   Egeria's death favored the rise of  Focalors , who would henceforth become the new Hydro Archon. The abandonment of Fontaine by the  Oceanids  can therefore be considered as an indirect consequence of the cataclysm, since they did not want to accept Focalors as the new Hydro Archon.  Furthermore, the  Melusines  were born from the remains of Elynas' body, and they mixed with the Fontanians thanks to the help of  Neuvillette , with Elynas' consciousness continuing to remain on the mortal plane as their guide. In any case, the coming and death of Elynas contaminated the lands and waters of Fontaine, and although Fontaine's researchers promised that the pollution had been cleansed, this factor may contribute to the current status of Fontaine's waters. [89]     Natlan [ ]   To prevent the Abyss from returning, the Pyro Archon periodically held the Pilgrimage of Sacred Flames, inviting the tribespeople of Natlan to participate in a tournament to determine who would be eligible to participate in the Night Warden Wars. The winners would be allowed to participate in a raid against the Abyss, provided they were bearers of an Ancient Name granted to them by the  Wayobs . According to legend, as long as the Sacred Flame was not extinguished, the majority of the Abyss would not be able to befall the nation. The Pyro Archon also granted the representatives of the Night Warden Wars with the \"Ode to Resurrection,\" which would allow them to resurrect the fallen name bearers during the incursion as long as one member of the team made it out victorious.  Despite this, the threat of the Abyss continued to loom over Natlan, causing disasters seemingly designed for each tribe: the waters of the  People of the Springs  were contaminated, the Children of Echoes' territory was invaded by dangerous sludge surging from underground and unrelenting black winds tore across the lands of the  Flower-Feather Clan . It was then suspected that the Abyss has invaded the  Night Kingdom  itself and therefore had the ability to read Natlan's memories at any time.  In order to stop its threat for good,  Mavuika  concocted a plan that would span over the course of 500 years to reunite the tribes and fight the Abyss with recognized and acknowledged Ancient Name bearers. However, corruption in the Night Kingdom prevented the information from being sent to the tribes, resulting in Mavuika having to wait for the tribes to be restored to their proper strength. By the time the Traveler had arrived in Natlan, three of the six Ancient Name bearers were prepared;  Xilonen ,  Kinich  and  Iansan . After entering the Night Kingdom to save  Kachina ,  Mualani  was also acknowledged, resulting in Mavuika waiting for the  Flower-Feather Clan  and  Masters of the Night-Wind  to prepare their Ancient Name bearer.    Snezhnaya [ ]   The Tsaritsa, embittered by what transpired, cut ties with Venti [90]  (and potentially the other Archons) and established the Fatui to combat the Abyss Order and to one day overthrow Celestia, with Pierro as the Director of the  Eleven Fatui Harbingers . Pierro took the initiative in recruiting powerful individuals, including La Signora and Scaramouche, granting them Delusions to bolster their abilities. The Tsaritsa also granted her Harbingers god-like executive authority, although it is unclear whether this refers to Delusions or if it is a separate power.

Merely two books mention the cataclysm, while only a handful of NPCs talk about it. [78] [94]  Even some Fatui members, despite knowing about the threat of the Abyss and fighting it firsthand, do not believe that their conflict has lasted over 500 years. [95]   Jean  mentions Khaenri'ah, [11]  but her knowledge of the cataclysm seems to be limited to the tale of Dvalin and Durin, which she learned from  Diluc [96]  after Venti revealed it to him. [97]  Paimon also states the Traveler has rummaged through old books searching for information about Khaenri'ah and the cataclysm, with little success. [10]  (It may be notable, however, that five-sixths of the  Mondstadt Library 's collection, which was once the largest in northern Teyvat, was lost following a large fire at an unknown point in time. [98] )  Information about the cataclysm primarily comes from  books ; artifact, weapon, and item descriptions; or first-hand sources like the Archons or Khaenri'ah survivors. Venti recounts the story of Durin and Dvalin to an audience [99]  but does not say when it occurred. After he plays the same song to Diluc, Diluc asks what he \"witnessed\" — implying Venti may have given him a vision of the battle — then states \"This is confidential information.\" [97]  Meanwhile,  Zhongli  has a contract that prevents him from speaking about the events of the cataclysm, [100]  while the adepti refused to speak about the events that led Dunyu Ruins to be abandoned. [64]  Ei admits that she still feels fear over what happened during the cataclysm, citing in particular, \"... Her demise  and that  thing ,\" though does not offer much more information as she only arrived after the worst of the fighting and was not herself the Electro Archon at the time.  While their numbers had dwindled since the cataclysm,  Riftwolves  (creations of Gold that have the ability to erode the world's boundaries) began appearing on the abandoned  Tsurumi Island  of Inazuma. More recently, they have appeared as far away as Mondstadt, where they have begun encroaching on  Wolvendom , the territory of  Boreas ' wolfpack. Following the repeal of the  Vision Hunt Decree , Riftwolves began appearing and making coordinated attacks against the roots of the  Sacred Sakura  on  Narukami Island , something which greatly troubled Ei as Riftwolves historically served as harbingers of worse terrors during the cataclysm.    The Traveler's Journey [ ]   It has been heavily suggested that the Traveler's journey will be intricately linked to the events of the cataclysm. The most obvious indication is the Gnostic Chorus trailer, in which Venti's narration suggests that the second heir — \"your story to be told\" — is the player and by extension, the Traveler.  The description for Mondstadt  Statues of The Seven  says that the statue \"anticipates the arrival of a noble soul [...] while thousand winds of time will soon unfold a new story.\" This \"noble soul\" is likely the Traveler, and it might not be a coincidence that both the Traveler [40]  and Venti [101]  woke up a few months before the start of the game. In the Gnostic Chorus trailer, both heirs start their journey in Mondstadt based on the background in the corresponding scene, which is also where the Traveler begins theirs.  When the Traveler confronts Zhongli about the destruction of Khaenri'ah and their sibling's relation to it, Zhongli refuses to divulge any information on account of his contract but appears to acknowledge the sibling:  \"If you take the same road as that person, there may be more difficulties ahead. But as long as you firmly believe that you are on the right path... everything has meaning.\" [100]     Related Material [ ]   Gnostic Chorus [ ]                     Story Teaser- Gnostic Chorus - English Voice-Over - Genshin Impact       \"An atrous sun befell its kingdom and a luminous pearl lost its glow.\" [Translation Note 5]  \"Niveous silk grew dim and wheaten gold burned brilliantly no more.\" —Breeze Amidst the Forest, about the fall of Khaenri'ah   The Gnostic Chorus story teaser that plays at the start of every new  Battle Pass  period may contain a link to the story of Celestia, Teyvat, Khaenri'ah, and by extension, the cataclysm. [Lore Discrepancy 1]  It is narrated by  Venti  in such a way that suggests that he is speaking to the player (and thus, the Traveler), while the background in the scene where either heir sets off on their journey has Mondstadt's visual cues — a forest, dandelions, and a mountain that strongly resembles Dragonspine.  The story teaser includes two heirs. Venti narrates that the story of the second heir is the story of the player (and thus, the Traveler). However, the first heir became the queen of the Kingdom of Darkness. The first heir's identity and her relationship to the Traveler — if any exists — are unknown.  Furthermore, the Gnostic Chorus teaser mentions a \"Genesis Pearl,\" while  Breeze Amidst the Forest  mentions \"a luminous pearl.\" The significance of this pearl and the reason why the \"kingdom among the heavens\" in the Gnostic Chorus teaser is seeking it out are unknown.    The Pale Princess and the Six Pygmies [ ]   The Abyss Order holds a vested interest in the fairytale  The Pale Princess and the Six Pygmies  due to a \"secret\" allegedly contained within it. [102]  However, their attempt to steal the book indicates that even they don't fully understand the contents of this series, so the exact nature of its secret is unknown.  One theory holds that this story may be allegorical for Khaenri'ah from the perspective of the people of Teyvat. Like the perpetually-dark Land of Night, Khaenri'ah was inhospitable and lifeless as a result of being an underground kingdom where light doesn't reach, which was why they turned to alchemy for plant life. [30]  The Night Mother may be based on \"Gold\" Rhinedottir, who was the origin of the monsters and described as a \"great sinner,\" just as the Night Mother is called \"the source of all sins.\"    Trivia [ ]   During the earlier  Closed Beta Tests , the cataclysm occurred 100 years before the start of the game's story. It was changed to 500 by the time of the game's official release, but some in-game text has not been changed accordingly, whether in Chinese or English. The most notable cases where the timeframe has not been updated are  Breeze Amidst the Forest  (Vol. 2) and some  Skyward Series  weapon descriptions.   In  Collected Miscellany - \"Venti: Skyward Sonnet,\"  Dainsleif, the narrator, says, \"A thousand years have passed since the God of Anemo left this land — But to me, it has only been half that time.\" Aside from almost certainly being related to certain events in the cataclysm due to the timeframe (500 years ago), it is currently unclear exactly what Dainsleif meant by this line.   The Gnostic Chorus story teaser is a retelling of the  Hymn of the Pearl , a passage in the  Acts of Thomas . The Hymn of the Pearl has been interpreted as a Gnostic allegory for their view of the  human condition : We are lost amidst the material world and consumed by worldly desires, which prevents us from achieving  gnosis  (divine wisdom) and transcending the mortal world.  Major differences between the Gnostic Chorus and the Hymn of the Pearl:  The protagonist of Hymn of the Pearl comes from an unspecified kingdom, while the land he seeks to take the pearl from is Egypt. In the Gnostic Chorus, those seeking the pearl hail from a \"kingdom established among the heavens,\" while the pearl is located in the \"Kingdom of Darkness.\"   In the Hymn of the Pearl, the protagonist is the second son of the \"king of kings;\" his older brother is mentioned as the \"second in command\" and the \"viceroy\" of their parents' kingdom, and the protagonist would join him if he succeeds in his task of retrieving the pearl. In the Gnostic Chorus, the one who seeks the pearl first is the first crowned heir, while the second crowned heir's story is yet unfinished.   Nobody else is assigned the task of retrieving the pearl in the Hymn of the Pearl: the protagonist's parents, realizing his plight, write him a letter (a metaphor for gnosis) that reminds him of his true heritage and his original task.   A common theme between the  Gnostic Hymn Series  weapons is that each weapon's original wielder either lost sight of, gave up, or was otherwise led astray from their original path or goal — typically as a result of someone else's influence, much like the protagonist of the Hymn of the Pearl forgot his origins and duty and believed himself to be an Egyptian.   Notes [ ]     ↑   There is no single proper name for this time period; \"cataclysm,\" one of the earliest terms used for it, is used by the wiki for standardization purposes.     ↑   In the original Chinese version of  Breeze Amidst the Forest, Vol. I ,  where the English localization says \"The alchemist known as Gold was corrupted by their own greed and ambition,\" it instead says  被称为「黄金」的炼金士堕落为了罪人  \"The alchemist known as Gold fell from grace and became a sinner.\"     ↑   This same quote was used in a Chinese-only official teaser for the Eleven Fatui Harbingers before  Tartaglia 's playable release.       Lore Discrepancies [ ]     ↑   It is difficult to identify a unified theme between the  Gnostic Hymn Series  weapons' descriptions, even though they supposedly comprise the Battle Pass story.  The Black Sword  and  The Viridescent Hunt 's stories are set during the cataclysm;  Deathmatch  and  Serpent Spine  both record stories of people who lived 1000 years ago, while  Solar Pearl 's era is unknown. Because there is no overt commonality between them, they may be linked to the overall narrative of the  Hymn of the Pearl , the real-life work that the Gnostic Chorus is based on. (See  Trivia  for details.)       Translation Notes [ ]     ↑   Compare the Chinese versions of Dottore's \"skies of Teyvat are fake\" ( Chinese :  「提瓦特的星空是虚假的」  \"'Teyvat's starry sky is fake'\" ) line in  Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies  with Scaramouche's line in  Where Ancient Stars Align : \"The stars, the sky... It's all a gigantic hoax. A lie.\" ( Chinese :  星空本身，就是个巨大的谎言。  \"The starry sky itself is a gigantic lie.\" )     ↑   The English localization's  \"'they also brought about illusions that could break through shackles to the land'\"  in Amethyst Crown's description is poorly worded, as it can be misconstrued to mean that the invaders had a power of illusions that was capable of breaking through shackles. The original Chinese text is clear that the invaders' attempt to break the shackles was doomed to fail.     ↑   In the original Chinese text, Chlothar specifies  \"And as long as Khaenri'ah could control the Abyss, they could control everything!\"  ( Chinese :  而坎瑞亚只要掌控了深渊，就能掌控一切！ ) The English localization can be misconstrued to mean they thought the Traveler's sibling could control the Abyss, so this clarification has been added.     ↑   In the original Chinese version, Scaramouche says \"Plus, it's because the Sky responded to the summoning that  (‍ she she Text for male Traveler / he he Text for female Traveler ‍)  descended on this world.\" ( Chinese :  而且，是因为「天空」回应了召唤， (‍ 她 她 Text for male Traveler / 他 他 Text for female Traveler ‍) 才降临至此世 ). Notably,  「天空」  \"Sky\"  is treated as a special term, which is not conveyed in the English localization.     ↑   The original Chinese version says  古国黑日落，明珠失其光 , which may be intended to be read as \"The ancient kingdom's atrous sun [black sun/eclipse] fell; the luminous pearl lost its glow.\" In this case, \"atrous (black) sun\" is referring to Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty ( Chinese :  黑日王朝 ), which was its ruling dynasty when the cataclysm occurred. The sentence is vague on whether the luminous pearl belonged to Khaenri'ah or not.       Editor's Assumptions [ ]     ↑   Currently, Khaenri'ah is the only known nation that was established with the intention of living without gods.     ↑   Because Ruin Machines were developed by the people of Khaenri'ah, the fact that Guizhong was able to collect some before she died 3,700 years ago indicates that Khaenri'ah already existed by then.     ↑   It can be assumed that the location of the opening cutscene is Celestia, based on the  \"Celestial motif\"  found on the architecture in the cutscene, on the architecture in the game's title screen (which, based on their appearance, is the same location as the opening cutscene), on the Skyfrost Nail and  Chasm Nail , and on fully-upgraded  Statues of The Seven .

Over the course of their 1,600-year reign, however, they went from being the noble protectors of the people to their tyrannical and oppressive overlords.  Their oppression of both citizens and foreigners alike eventually roused the Anemo Archon  Barbatos  from his slumber, and he assisted the foreign-born gladiator  Vennessa  in her rebellion against the aristocracy. The resistance emerged victorious and most of the aristocracy was exiled from Mondstadt.

Notable Features [ ]   Liyue features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards:    The Chasm [ ]   Five  Bedrock Keys  are found in the aboveground part of  The Chasm  which must be destroyed to break the seal over the  Underground Mines  in the  World Quest   Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering  in Series  The Chasm Delvers . The player must charge each nearby  Cage-Shaped Geo Formation  using  Geograna , then attack the formation to strike the key. The key is destroyed when this has been done with all the nearby formations.   Dangerous Gas  reacts with  Electro  and  Pyro , producing an explosion, while  Anemo  temporarily dissipates it.   Exploding Geo Mushrooms   (unofficial name)  explode after a short delay, sometimes destroying nearby structures. The player and enemies will incur damage if they are near one when it explodes.   The    Lumenstone Adjuvant  is obtained during the  World Quest   Chasm Spelunkers  in Series  The Chasm Delvers . When equipped and energized, it lights the player's surroundings in  The Chasm: Underground Mines  and enables certain actions. The Adjuvant is disabled if unequipped or drained of energy.  The Adjuvant's energy is quickly recharged to full when the player stands next to certain objects with the Adjuvant equipped:  Teleport Waypoint  (when activated)   Ruin Brazier  (if unlocked)   Lumenlamp  (if unlocked)   Luminous Seelie   Other actions can restore a limited amount of energy to the equipped Adjuvant:  Interacting with  Concentrated Lumenstone Energy   (unofficial name)   Breaking glowing ore rocks   Killing    Bluethudner Weasels   Catching    Lucklight Flies   Collecting    Starshrooms   Some objects may be surrounded by a blue seal, which require spending 1 energy with the Adjuvant to unlock it before the player can interact with it:  Chest   Lumenlamp   Ruin Brazier   Time Trial Challenge   Lumentorches   (unofficial name)  can be activated when approached by the player stands nearby with the energized Adjuvant equipped, or by a  Luminous Seelie . This does not cost any of the Adjuvant's energy. Lighting all nearby Lumentorches unlocks a chest.   Dark Mud  quickly drains energy from the Adjuvant while inhibiting  Sprinting  and sapping the player's  HP . Enemies within it gain  ATK  and  Resistance  to all  DMG . If an  Oozing Concretion  is found within a patch of mud, a sufficiently upgraded Adjuvant can be used to destroy it, which will disperse the mud and potentially reveal objects it covered. Oozing Concretions and their associated Dark Mud respawn with the next  Reset .   The  Hidden Exploration Objective   Secret Messages in The Chasm  requires the player to locate and interact with nine glowing rune phrases on the walls. A rune phrase will disappear if the player nears it with the Adjuvant equipped and energized, preventing interaction. The player must unequip or drain the Adjuvant first.   The Adjuvant can be upgraded by bringing    Lumenspar  and    Lumenstone Ore  to  Jinwu .   Lumencages   (unofficial name)  can be attacked to fire projectiles to destroy nearby targets.   Mine Passageways   (unofficial name)  can be found that allow the player to travel between a point in  The Chasm: Underground Mines  and an above-ground location in  Teyvat .   A special type of  Pressure Plate  is found here that requires the player to touch a sequence of points to unlock a chest.   A  Spoutrock  drastically increases the player's jumping height when they stand on it and momentarily prevent  Fall Damage .   Unique Rocks  can be broken by the reverberations that come from a  Unique Rock Pillar  when attacked.  Geo Constructs  propagate these reverberations, allowing the player to extend their range.   Chenyu Vale [ ]   Fujin  grants the player the ability to use adeptal energy on first entering  Chenyu Vale . An object which can be manipulated or used with adeptal energy has a leaping carp icon over it that turns yellow when the player is facing it and is in range. Pressing the corresponding button will cause the player to interact with that object.    Certain objects can be repositioned to solve puzzles, including pieces of masonry (as part of the  Millennia of History  mechanic),  Carefree Simulacra , and  Jade Cascade  hairpins (the latter occurring in the  World Quest   An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade  in Series  Chenyu's Blessings of Sunken Jade ).   Flighty Simulacra  allow a nearby player to jump to great heights, similar to  Spoutrocks .   Golden Carp's Leap  is an exploration mechanic where the player can use adeptal energy on special floating water pearls to transform into a golden carp and fly to the pearl's location. From there, the player can fly a short distance in any direction before turning back into their original form.  Wrathful Simulacra  act similarly to water pearls, but also allow the player to deploy their own water pearls anywhere they like within a certain radius.   There are also special pearls that cause the player's golden carp to fly on a predetermined path, but these must be interacted with directly in the typical fashion rather than at a distance with adeptal energy.   Interacting with a  Jade Incense Cauldron  using adeptal energy causes the orb within to fly to the player, or back to the cauldron if the player already has the orb. Censers near the orb's flight path will be temporarily lit. Light all nearby censers at once to solve the puzzle.   Large  Lotus Lanterns  light up smaller lanterns within a certain radius. Adeptal energy can be used to pick up and reposition the large lantern. The smaller lanterns remain lit for a brief time after leaving the large lantern's radius of influence. Light all nearby smaller lanterns at once to solve the puzzle.   Miasma  affects nearby monsters, making them more violent. Miasma encounters come in three waves; in each wave, the player must defeat the leader of the group of monsters, then interact with the miasma source using adeptal energy to purify it.   Other [ ]   Adeptus Bridges  are golden, ribbon-like structures that the player can walk on to cross over gaps, usually found in the abodes of  Adepti . Some can be activated, deactivated, or rotated using nearby activation points.   Amber Rocks  are  Geo Constructs  found at  Mt. Hulao . Breaking them open releases a trapped object inside, which may be wildlife, an enemy, or a  Common Chest . Ambers regenerate periodically, and their contents are random each time. Once a chest is collected from a particular amber, it will never produce a chest again.     Geoculi  can be offered at  Statues of the Seven  in Liyue for rewards.   Geo Lamps  can be lit by standing next to one while holding a  Geogranum . Lighting all nearby Geo Lamps triggers an effect.   Plaustrite Platforms   (unofficial name)  are floating platforms which are usually part of a puzzle. Some are static, while others may appear or move in response to some interaction.

Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail       In the trailer  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail , under the title of the quest  Farewell, Archaic Lord , there is a line written in Teyvat's  Latin script . It reads \" Ruat caelum fiat pactum ,\" which roughly means \"Though the heavens fall, let the contract be made,\" and is modified from the phrase  fiat justitia ruat caelum .   Liyue is the most prosperous of the seven regions.   As of  Chapter I , Liyue is the only region to ostensibly not have a  ruling  archon at all, after Morax faked his death in the quest  Rite of Descension .   Etymology [ ]   Liyue ( 璃月   Líyuè ) literally means \"Glazed Moon\" in Chinese. In addition, miHoYo has also offered \"Jade Moon\" as a viable translation, using the radical of  玉  (jade) in Liyue's  Li   璃 .   Liyue's  Li  ( 璃 ) can be decomposed into  王   wáng , \"king\"  and  离   lí , \"departure\" , which is the same  li  found in  Zhongli 's name in Simplified Chinese. The  yue  ( 月 ) in Liyue can also mean \"month,\" therefore, Liyue's name could possibly have a secondary meaning: \"The Month of the King's Departure,\" which bears striking similarity to a possible interpretation of Zhongli's name (\"time of departure\").   璃月   Líyuè  is a near homophone of  礼乐   lǐyuè , \"rites and music\" , a word that represents the  Confucian  aspect of the traditional Chinese philosophy and culture. [4]   Lǐ  (rite/courtesy) is a visible practice to maintain the order of both a human society and the universe, since the orders of human, terrestrial, and celestial realms are considered to be connected in the Chinese philosophy.  Yuè  (music) symbolizes the cultural harmony of a society. [4]   璃月   Líyuè  is also a near homophone of \"establishing a contract\" ( Chinese :  立约 ;  Romansh :  lìyuē ).   In-game lore defines the country Liyue ( Chinese :  璃月   Líyuè ) to be established in Guili Plain before the Archon Wars while the Morax's mortal name \"Zhongli\" was chosen after the Seven. Thus the in-game etymology of \"Liyue\" leads to deeper lore.  In Xiao's Story  \"Ode to Windborne Wraith\" , the book \"Tour of the Land of Liyue\"  ( Chinese :  琉璃岩间国土纪行  lit. \"Tour of the Land among the Rock of Glaze\" ) written by Sumeru Akademiya was renamed as \"Hidden Diamond and Cloudy Moon: Wonders and Folklores of Liyue\"  ( Chinese :  匣中琉璃云间月  lit. \"Glaze in the Box, Moon among the Clouds\" ) in Liyue.  琉璃  \"glaze\"  and  月  \"moon\"  are the two main elements in the etymology of Liyue.  Qingzhou  translates the phrase  匣中琉璃云间月  lit. \"Glaze in the Box, Moon among the Clouds\"  as \"As man hides Li in a box, so nature hides Yue between the clouds,\" and explains that \"Li\" is a \"precious ceramic ornament\" and \"Yue\" refers to the moon.   Deeper lore connects to the sword  Lion's Roar   ( Chinese :  匣里龙吟  \"Dragon's Roar in the Box\" ). Lion's Roar is inspired by a famous poem  ( Chinese :  古剑篇  \"Tale of the Ancient Sword\" ), [5]  which describes the casting of an ancient sword which \"like a white lotus spit out from a glazed jade box, the golden ring on the hilt of the sword is dyed with the brilliance of the sun and the moon\"  ( Chinese :  琉璃玉匣吐莲花，错镂金环映明月 ). This is the most likely in-game etymology of \"Liyue.\"   Cultural References [ ]   Liyue is inspired by China.   Liyue Harbor is said to be an economical center, similar to many port cities in China.   Morax, the founder of Liyue, quotes some proverbs from the  Analects  of Confucius in a (non-canon) official blog post. [6]   Divine Body from Guyun  says a variety of different ideals were born and died during the  Archon War , where Liyue survived the war. It may be a reference to the  Hundred Schools of Thought  during the  Warring States period  of Ancient China, where the Confucian philosophy of \"Liyue\" (Rites and Music) survived the war in academia.

    "Sakoku_Decree": "Sakoku Decree     Type   Lore       Region   Inazuma       The  Sakoku Decree  ( Japanese :  鎖国令   Sakoku-rei ) [1]  was an order issued by  Ei 's puppet,  the Shogun , to shut down the borders of  Inazuma . [2]   People who want to leave or enter Inazuma legally must pass the strict assessments conducted by the  Kanjou Commission  to obtain permission. Those who are not Inazuman cannot leave  Ritou  without a  Travel Permit  as a result. However, such restrictions did not initially apply to the  Fatui  and  Snezhnayan  merchants due to their diplomatic ties.  The  Tenryou Commission  also enforces the Sakoku Decree. [3]   To enforce the Sakoku Decree, the Shogun surrounded Inazuma with storms, resulting in very few ships being able or willing to navigate them and harming Inazuma's economy. These storms are encountered in-game as  A Nation Closed by Thunder , and they prevent players from entering Inazuma before the  Archon Quest   Setting Sail  in  Chapter II : Act I -  The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia , as well as traveling to and from Inazuma without teleportation, such as with  Teleport Waypoints .  When the Vision Hunt Decree was abolished, the Sakoku Decree had not immediately followed suit. [4]  However, the restrictions placed upon foreigners were relaxed and the decree was expected to be lifted soon after. After her duel against the Shogun in  Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter : Act II -  Transient Dreams , Ei abolishes the Sakoku Decree, resulting in an influx of visitors and foreign trade returning to normal.

Description [ ]   Sumeru's landscape features both deserts [1]  and forests. [2] [3]  In  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail ,  Dainsleif  likens it to a desert, and  Liben  mentions that \"Sumeru is all rainforest and desert.\"  During the  cataclysm  500 years ago, the previous Dendro Archon and God of Wisdom,  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata , was slain [4]  and Lesser Lord Kusanali took her place. [5]  Under the aegis of the God of Wisdom, the sages of Sumeru drive themselves into hysterics and abandon all that is worldly in their pursuit of esoteric wisdom. [2]   Lisa  went to study magic at the Sumeru Akademiya, where she was considered the best student they had seen in 200 years. Despite the prestige she enjoyed there, she ultimately returned to  Mondstadt  after growing disillusioned with the \"raving-mad scholars\" and the cost of \"uninhibited erudition\" she witnessed in Sumeru.  The  Eremites  are a faction of mercenaries from Sumeru who travel throughout Teyvat. [6]  They see themselves as people who are not \"afraid of dying so that they might truly live.\" [7]   Nazafarin , a scholar from Sumeru, claims that some of its members wield \"bizarre yet formidable powers,\" and finds the subject of the Eremite unpleasant enough to swiftly drop the subject after briefly explaining them to the  Traveler . [8]   Sumeru's  Statue of The Seven  depicts a childlike female figure who wears a similar cloak and draping clothing to that of the other known Archon statues. Her small frame is also shown sitting on a huge leaf, an attribute owing to her mantle as the Dendro Archon.

Notable Features [ ]   Sumeru features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards. Some are found throughout Sumeru, while others can only be found in one of its subregions:    Common [ ]     Dendroculi  can be offered at  Statues of The Seven  in Sumeru for rewards.   Dendrograna  augment  Charged Attacks  and  Aimed Shots  with a  Dendro -based attack. Dendrogranum attacks are the only way to destroy  Dendrogranum-Locked Rocks , Fetid Boughs, and Withering Branches and trigger  Valaya . They are summoned at  Auspicious Branches .   Energy Blocks  are used to power relays within some  Ruin Golems .   Four-Leaf Sigils  permit the player to rapidly traverse the terrain and travel to areas that may otherwise be difficult to reach.   Primeval Rosin  is used to unlock paths in  Domains .   Stamina Flowers  ( unofficial name ) grant 80  Stamina  when approached.   Tri-Lakshana Creatures  can change between different states when an  Element  is applied: Scorched (inactive) from  Pyro , Normal from  Dendro , and Activated from  Electro :  Bouncy Mushroom : Launches the player into the air (higher when Activated).   Dream Flower : Clears enemy  Aggro  for nearby players (Normal) and reveals Phantasmal Seeds (Activated).     Fungus : Dropped items on defeat will change depending on state.   Poisonous Mushroom : Attacks with  Dendro  when not Scorched.   Rocklifting Branch : Rises from the ground in Normal state, revealing hidden objects underneath (rises higher when Activated)   Seed Mirror : Reveals Nascent Withering Zones (Normal), reveals  Mischievous Aranara  (Activated).     Starshroom : Restore  health  when consumed: 1 HP (Scorched), 300 HP (Normal), 800 HP (Activated).   Tri-Yana Seed : Can be immobile (Scorched), moving (Normal), or reveal hidden objects (Activated).   The Withering  is a  climate  effect that causes dangerous areas called Withering Zones, which apply Decay to the player. If the player accumulates 10 units of Decay, all their characters will  fall . The player must use  Dendrograna  to destroy all Withering Branches within the zone, defeat the enemies that spawn, then interact with the Tumor of the Withering to permanently eliminate the Withering Zone.  Fetid Boughs may attack the player, doing damage and applying a unit of Decay when hit.   Flames of Life  may appear within the zone, which remove one unit of Decay when consumed.   Seelies of Life  ( unofficial name ) and  Candles of Life  can continually remove accumulated Decay for nearby players, as will any  Teleport Waypoint  that happens to be located within the zone.   Dharma Forest [ ]   Ashvattha's Concourses  are locations that each contain a  Vasara Tree  that is infected with  The Withering . The player must cleanse these areas during the  World Quest  Series  Aranyaka : Part II -  Dream Nursery .   Applying  Dendro  to  Clusterleaves of Cultivation  will spawn  Four-Leaf Sigils  that will last for 24 hours.   Energy Extraction Devices  are challenges found in  Eremite  forts. You must find control keys and defeat enemies to deactivate them.   Nurseries  are puzzles that grant a    Vasmrti  and a  Chest  when solved.   Stone Pillar Seals  can be neutralized with  Pyro  to release    Ruin Machines .   Playing the    Vintage Lyre  can activate various objects, once the corresponding song has been unlocked:  Remove obstacles near  Claustroflora   Repair  Dendro   Elemental Monuments  (can also be repaired using the    \"Kusava\" )   Gain access to  Domains  via  Gloomy Paths   Switch between the real and dream worlds at  Silapna   Summon a  Healthy Dendrograna  at  Sprouting Branches   Rotate  Vamadha   Activate  Varuna Contraptions , enabling the player to change the weather in  Apam Woods   Unlock challenges at  Phantasmal Gates   Please  Music-Loving Aranara   Great Red Sand [ ]   Atmospheric Vortices come in  small  and  large  varieties. They function as walls which push the player back on contact but do no damage. Touching one with    Jinni in the Magic Bottle — Liloupar  equipped drains some of the Jinni's Might from the bottle and dispels the Vortex. Large Vortices require the bottle to be upgraded to level 6. Jinni's Might can be replenished at  Jinn Shrines .   Cascade Spouts  emit sand into  Cascade Pools . They can be toggled on and off with attacks. For most of them, completely filling all the Pools in a puzzle area with sand grants a  Chest .   There are three  Flower Buds   (unofficial name)  which exist only in the  Eternal Oasis . Touching one causes it to move along a trail of purple flowers to specific locations, where you can select  Activate Memory  to cause changes in the environment which can unblock the Bud's path and reveal  Chests . Leading each Bud to its destination grants a  Memories of the Eternal Oasis  (   I ,    II ,    III ) item and another  Chest .   Illusory Keystones  are platforms that disappear a few seconds after the player steps on them.   Loose Sand Piles  can cover objects or enemies. They can be dispersed with  Anemo  or by an obscured enemy who senses the player's presence.   Manifestation Mechanisms  can be activated to release a Signal Spirit. Escort the Spirit to each Mechanism in a chain. Bringing the Spirit to the final Mechanism grants a  Chest .   Mysterious Murals  appear in pairs. Interacting with one at night spawns enemies. Defeating all enemies spawned by both murals grants a  Chest .   Primal Obelisks  can be used to locate  Sacred Seals , which can then be returned to the Obelisk. Returning all of an Obelisk's Seals grants a Precious  Chest .   Ruin Devices are mostly found within and around temples. Each device has a clearance requirement that you must fulfill by upgrading the    Scarlet Sand Slate .  Everlight Cells  can be moved or rotated to cause  Primal Beams  to strike targets called  Neverlight Cells . Some Everlight Cells revert to their original state a certain amount of time after the player interacts with them. Dual Everlight Cells emit two beams, and Dual Neverlight Cells must be struck by two beams to activate. Sometimes an obstructing wall may need to be made transparent by activating nearby  Obscuring Cells .   Large Fan Blades  may cycle between active and inactive states automatically, or be controlled by a  Plinth of the Secret Rites . While active, they can push the player or obliterate  Primal Embers .   Pipe Diverter Valves  can adjust pipe connections, changing the flow of sand within them.   Plinths of the Secret Rites  can be used to perform various actions, such as opening doors, removing  Primal Barriers , or turning  Large Fan Blades  on and off. Different Plinths require varying levels of clearance.   Primal Barriers  are forcefield-like obstacles that must be turned off to allow the player to pass.   Flipping a  Primal Sandglass  reveals the locations of other nearby Sandglasses. After a certain amount of time, a flipped Sandglass will flip back. Usually, getting all nearby Sandglasses in the flipped state at once will complete the puzzle. Sometimes, the Sandglasses are simply part of a larger puzzle that spawns objects such as  Four-Leaf Sigils  while any nearby Sandglass is flipped.   Primal Embers  can be located resting within  Primal Sconces . Interacting with one causes it to move along a predefined path. The Ember may stop at another sconce until the player interacts with it again, or at other locations, waiting until the player approaches. Leading the Ember to a  Primal Torch  causes the Torch to activate. Often there will be multiple Torches in a room which must be activated to solve a puzzle.   Prisms of Khaj-Nisut  can glow blue or red, and are used to control objects of the same color. You can also interact with them to change their color and colors of other objects.   Replicator Keystones  can be activated with  Forged Primal Light  to create ruin devices.   Rune Mechanisms  emit a beam of energy that can remove sand piles. Attack them to change the beam's direction. Some are mounted on tracks which allow them to be moved. The energy may be blocked by a  Runic Window , which can be opened by using a  Runic Pane Switch .   Activating  Verity Cells  causes hidden objects near the player to be revealed for a limited time.   Intermittent  Sandstorms  reduce visibility in the  Desert of Hadramaveth . Intensity increases with proximity to the heart of the storm. The    Jinni in the Magic Bottle — Liloupar  predicts when a sandstorm is approaching and significantly improves visibility in a sandstorm when equipped. If the magic bottle has been upgrade to at least level 5, the player can summon or dispel Sandstorms at the branch within any  Jinn Shrine .   Suda's Flow  manifests as glowing orbs surrounded by vines, only appearing inside the  Ruin Golem  in the  Valley of Dahri . Any attack destroys them, and destroying all the ones associated with a seal removes the seal.   Tumbleweeds  can be found rolling across the  Great Red Sand . Running into or attacking one will destroy it, sometimes releasing an item.   Weathered Obelisks  come in groups, with each Obelisk having a matching one nearby. With each pair of Obelisks, one has a symbol that can be changed with an attack, while the other does not change. Make all changeable Obelisks in a group match their pairs to solve the puzzle.   Weathered Rocks  can be damaged by  Wenut  attacks.   Girdle of the Sands [ ]   Gray Crystals  block passages, or encase enemies, interactable objects, or energy control systems. These Crystals can be dissipated by bringing a  Farrwick  nearby.   Kory Drums  can be played using attacks. Finding and playing Kory Drums is required to complete the  World Quest   Awakening's Real Sound  in Series  Khvarena of Good and Evil .   Rune Mechanims  can unlock devices within the Khaenri'ahn ruins below  Tunigi Hollow .   Obtaining    Sorush (Gadget)  during the  World Quest   The Splendorous Sky That Day  in Series  Khvarena of Good and Evil  grants the player a number of abilities:  The player can switch control to Sorush, who can fly anywhere within a fixed distance from the player.   The player can receive rewards by igniting  Bright Flame Altars , absorbing energy from  Burgeoning Spirits , awakening Residual  Pari  inside  Fravashi Trees , and causing  Sunyata Flowers  in the  Vourukasha Oasis  to bloom and bringing  Amrita Mayflies  to them.   Defiled Beacons  can be purified to stop their attacks.   Great Songs of Khvarena  are protected by a barrier which Sorush can pass through once she has obtained the Twin-Horned Chaplet.   Khvarena Barriers  can be activated to provide a temporary shield.   Khvarena Inscription Fragments ,  Lightcall Paths , and  Mysterious Floating Stones  can be made visible.   Sorush can temporarily dispel  Mysterious Amrita Seals  to allow the player to pass.   The power of  Nirodha Fruit  can be used to destroy Solidified Amrita or  Purple Mist  in  Asipattravana Swamp .   She can collect  Plumes of Purifying Light  to offer to the  Amrita Pool .   Special Four-Leaf Sigils  can be moved to more advantageous locations.   Ruebright Blooms  can be activated to create platforms and  Four-Leaf Sigils .   She can cause Udumbara flowers to sprout from Runestones in  Asipattravana Swamp , allowing the player to collect    Udumbara Pistils , which are offered to the Residual  Pari  in two of the  Fravashi Trees .   A  Trial of the Soul Bell  requires the player to interact with a Soul Bell, then reach each checkpoint in turn until the end to receive a reward.

 N/A Unnamed Madinat al-Nuhas Soundtrack 1 N/A Madinat al-Nuhas ,  Hangeh Afrasiyab   (factory)   Trivia [ ]             Screenshot from  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail       In the trailer  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail , under the title of the quest  Truth Amongst the Pages of Purana , there is a line written in Teyvat's  Latin script . It reads \" Sub floreis lumen sagacitatis \" which translates to \"Under the flowery light of sagacity.\"   Sumeru's local specialty wine is frigid snake wine. [9]   A bubble universe known as \"Seed of Sumeru\" also exists in  Honkai Impact 3rd ,  HoYoverse ' s previous game.   Khaenri'ah  is located directly underneath Sumeru. A massive underground gate to the ruined nation can be seen beneath  Hangeh Afrasiyab , a large underground Khaenri'ahn outpost beneath  Tunigi Hollow .   Etymology [ ]   Sumeru is one of the many names of  Mount Meru  ( Sanskrit :  मेरु ), a sacred five-peaked mountain in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist cosmology.  The Chinese name for Sumeru,  须弥   Xūmí , is also the Chinese name for Mount Meru.   Cultural References [ ]   Sumeru is inspired by both  South Asian  and  Middle Eastern  cultures.   Zoroastrianism  and the  Avestan  language are prominently featured in relation to  Sumeru Akademiya , particularly in its titles for students and researchers and the names of its six main schools, the Six Darshans, which are each named after one of the  Amesha Spenta .  Lesser Lord Kusanali, the current Dendro Archon, is described as the provider of \"Anahitian Blessing.\" In Zoroastrianism,  Anahita  (Anāhīd/Nahid) was a goddess of \"the Waters\" and subsequently associated with fertility, healing, and wisdom. [10]   Concepts from  Dharmic religions , particularly  Hinduism  and  Buddhism , are prominently featured in Sumeru quests; in the names of locations, plants, and items indigenous to Dharma Forest; and in the lore of various locations in Dharma Forest.  The three God-Kings of Sumeru — Greater Lord Rukkhadevata,  Nabu Malikata , and  King Deshret  — may be inspired by the  Trimurti , a Hindu concept in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified as a triad of deities. Some NPCs also have names of Vedic origin.   Several terms used in Sumeru's lore are derived from the names of Vedic deities, such as the  Varuna Contraption  (named after the Hindu god of water,  Varuna ),  Aranyaka  (named after  Aranyaka ). The Dendro Archons' common names, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and Lesser Lord Kusanali, are also derived from Dharmic concepts.   Some Vedic inspiration can be seen in the Sumeru Archon Quests' fifth Act title,  Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises  ( Chinese :  虚空鼓动，劫火高扬  \"Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises High\" ):  Akasha, in reference to the  Akasha System , takes its name from the Sanskrit word  akasha  ( Sanskrit :  आकाश   ākāśa ), meaning \"sky,\" \"space,\" or \" aether .\"   In Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, a  kalpa  ( Sanskrit :  कल्प ) is an immense period of time, generally between the creation and recreation of a world or universe. Therefore, an alternate translation for the phrase  劫灰   jiéhuī  can also be \"kalpa ash,\" referring to the ashes left behind at the destruction of a world at the end of a kalpa. [11]   Sumeru's ultimately unused featured Act title in  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail ,  Truth Amongst the Pages of Purana  ( Chinese :  虚空劫灰往世书  \"The Puranas of Akasha Calamity Ash,\" ) contains another Vedic reference:  Puranas  ( Sanskrit :  पुराण   purāṇa ;  Chinese :  往世书 ) are a genre of Indian literature that covers a wide array of subjects, typically relating to legends and other traditional lore. It is also a Hindi word meaning \"old\" in a nostalgic or memorable context.   The Vedic concept of  samsara  ( Sanskrit :  संसार ), a word which means \"world\" and now primarily refers to the process of reincarnation, is prominently used during Act I to refer to the sages' dream-harvesting scheme, and is later used to refer to Lesser Lord Kusanali's relationship to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.   Several NPCs, mentioned or historical characters, and clans have names inspired by prominent figures from the  Islamic Golden Age , such as the  House of Purbiruni  ( al-Biruni ), the  House of Pursina  ( Ibn Sina ),  Alhaitham  ( Ibn al-Haytham ), and Firnas ( Abbas ibn Firnas ).   Sumeru music is a mix of both South Asian (especially Indian  Hindustani classical music ) and Middle Eastern music. In some areas,  Yoga  music is also played. The desert region is mostly based on ancient Egypt and so is the music.   The  Great Red Sand , particularly the remains of King Deshret's civilization, is heavily inspired by Ancient Egypt.   The  Tanit  tribe and its matriarch,  Babel , are ultimately a reference to the fall of  Babylon  as described in the Bible. Babylon, the capital city of the Mesopotamian  Babylonian  empire, was known as the center of learning and scientific advancement during its prime, but prophets in the Bible predicted that its sins would cause its eventual collapse.

Genshin Impact Official Website   A story that has never been heard, a legend that has been forgotten, like a lost kingdom sunken beneath the waves, yearning for a bard to sing its drowned songs. Following the direction of pure currents, crossing wilderness, the depths of the forests and vastness of the sea of sand, arriving at the origin of all the waters of the continent. At the top of the waterfall, in the depths of the capital atop the terrestrial sea, the curtain softly rises on the start of the adventure's next chapter. Version 4.0 Preview Page   Of the regions of Teyvat, Fontaine prides itself as the hub of culture and the arts; or in the words of  Francis , a traveling merchant from the region, \"true beauty and elegance.\" The newspaper  The Steambird  is the main newspaper of the  Court of Fontaine ;  Mona  is a columnist on it, suggesting that they have writers from all across Teyvat. According to the Steambird, Fontaine is located in the center of Teyvat [3]  and is the source of all waters on the continent. Its entire continental plate is elevated, making it significantly higher than other nations. At the edge of Fontaine is a massive waterfall that stretches for thousands of meters.  Fontaine boasts its immersion in the development of technology, as referenced in multiple story points — such as the  Mikage Furnace , designed by Fontaine engineers, including  Xavier ; and limited events — such as in  Fabulous Fungus Frenzy , where the  Wisdom Orb  is a Fontaine-local-designed equipment designed to suppress specific behaviors in organisms.  Minor events that have featured Fontaine's technologic prowess include  Core of the Apparatus , which features Fontainian inventions that can manufacture toys and furnishings, and  Evermotion Mechanical Painting , which features mechanical gear systems.  There is a  special energy system  in Fontaine; however, it is mentioned to be on the verge of declining, causing many people to seek alternative sources. [4]  Additionally,  Santon  states that the air in Fontaine is \"practically toxic fumes\" and that there is much less connection to nature there, though he is not necessarily referring to the entire region. [5]   According to  Vasco , a  diving  certificate can be obtained in Fontaine, and diving itself is an important profession in the nation.  Liben  had described Fontaine's locals as believing that some type of \"judgment\" was \"soon to come,\" possibly in reference to the prophecy described in the  Archon Quests  about the nation being destroyed by rising sea levels to absolve its people of their \"sin.\"  The  Fontaine Research Institute  is located in Fontaine, though its original main buildings were destroyed in an experiment conducted by  Edwin Eastinghouse .  Other races also reside in Fontaine, such as the  Melusine  and, once upon a time, the  Oceanids .

Notable Features [ ]   Fontaine features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards:    Arkhe [ ]   Arkhe  is composed of two opposing energy types:  Ousia  and  Pneuma . When they meet, an annihilation reaction will be triggered. A character that possesses an Arkhe alignment can trigger a reaction by performing a Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attack on an object with the opposite alignment.  There are various ways that a character can gain an Arkhe alignment:    Fontanian characters  all have an innate Arkhe alignment.   Furina  can switch her Arkhe alignment by performing a Charged Attack.   The  Traveler  has  Pneuma  alignment while resonated with  Hydro .   The  Sword of Narzissenkreuz  grants an Arkhe alignment while it is equipped. This alignment can be switched at the \"Little Fountain\" in  Annapausis .   Characters can receive a temporary Arkhe alignment by picking up a  Pneumousia Block . This temporary alignment expires after a short time, or when an Arkhe reaction is triggered.   Arkhe reactions can cause the following effects:    Temporarily shutting down    Clockwork Meka   Stopping an  Enhanced Pneumousia Amplifier  from applying buffs to nearby enemies   Launching  The Miraculous Antoine Roger Aircraft , which will typically grant a  Remarkable Chest  upon reaching its destination after dealing with any obstacles   Balancing a  Pneumousia Relay , which can trigger various effects   Opening a  Pneumousia Storage Box   Diving [ ]   Unlocking the first  Statue of the Seven  in Fontaine grants the  Diving  ability. Rather than only being able to swim along the surface of the water, players can also dive and explore below the surface. This applies to all swimmable bodies of water in Fontaine except the sea around  Petrichor .    While in any body of water which permits diving, the player will not consume  Stamina  and cannot  drown . Fast swimming consumes Aquatic Stamina instead, and when it depletes the player must slow down, similar to how  sprinting  works on land.   Normal Attacks ,  Elemental Skills , and  Elemental Bursts  are disabled while in the water. Instead, the player has a weak \"water string\" attack that does a small amount of damage to enemies. However, this attack can be used on  Xenochromatic Creatures  to acquire various abilities from them (see  Xenochromatic Abilities  below).   Allogravity-Condensed Water Bodies  are floating cubes of water found at the site of the  Fontaine Research Institute  explosion. The player can dive inside them just like most other bodies of water in Fontaine.  The player receives an on-screen warning if they approach the side or bottom boundaries of the cube; continuing and crossing said boundary will cause the player to start falling.   During the  World Quest   Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble  in Series  Fontaine Research Institute Chronicles , several of the cubes are contaminated by condensing components from the exploded Arkhium reactor.  These cubes  have a purple tint and the player diving inside them will continuously accumulate Turbulent Energy Flow until the condensing component is found and removed. Accumulating too much Turbulent Energy Flow causes all characters to  drown .   Entering a  Current  will cause the player to move quickly along a pre-determined path, only able to control movement laterally within it.   Hidden underwater locations and objects can be revealed by touching an  Echoing Conch  or using the Sonar Waves Xenochromatic ability.   Huge Shells  contain objects which are revealed when struck.   The player can recover  HP  by touching a  Recovery Orb .   Energy Storage Devices [ ]   Energy storage devices  can be used to power machines.    The Fixed Storage Device is locked in place, while the Energy Transfer Device can be picked up and deployed near an object to be powered.   These devices are red when uncharged and blue/green when charged.   Some machines require power from a charged energy storage device to function:  Boxing Dummies  (unofficial name)  must be attacked to trigger an effect.   An  Energy Transfer Terminal  can be used to extract energy from one device and transfer it to another. The player may need to switch to another terminal (by pointing at it with the viewfinder) to be able to see the target object. These terminals are also used to read  Cipher Letters  and occasionally operate other machines.   Stabilizers  require the player to attack it while its indicator is within a blue zone three times to trigger an effect.   Flying Energy Thieves  are glowing balls found in the  Geode Mine Shaft  that disable a storage device carried by the player.   The Symphony [ ]   Available only in the  Nostoi Region , the  Symphony  is a game mechanic where the player can cause objects with musical note icons above them to stop or start moving.    Mysterious Bookshelves  are doorways in the  Faded Castle . To open one, the player uses the Symphony to halt a  Mysterious Grimoire , capture it, deliver it to the Bookshelf, then use the Symphony to move the books out of the way.   The  Ancient Autoharmonic Music Box  is powered by the Symphony. The player can find scores and play them on the Music Box to unlock rewards and reveal the history of  Remuria .   Auric Anglerfish  are large mechanical fish, each of which holds a chest in its mouth. Using the Symphony to pause one while near its tail will cause it to stop and hold its mouth open for a brief time, allowing the player to collect the chest.   Autoharmonic Reed Pipes  are devices which can be calibrated to one of three different notes with the Symphony. They are always found in groups, and the puzzle is solved when all Reed Pipes at a location are set correctly.   The  Faded Castle  contains a stage that hosts a special challenge that will test the player's skills with the Symphony.   Scylla  looks like a whale, but he is a powerful  Vishap  that lives in the waters of the  Sea of Bygone Eras . He is initially bound by  Dragonborn-Suppressing Shackles , which the player must release by solving Symphony-based puzzles. Once he is free, Scylla is usually within sight of the player while swimming in the Sea, and tapping a button will cause the player to be rapidly drawn to him. While next to Scylla, the same action will allow the player to be quickly propelled in any direction away from him.   Certain special coral formations contain  Swaying Eels ; the player can interact with a formation to get the Eels to pop in and out. Use the Symphony to pause them when they are all out to solve the puzzle.   Washer Octopi  respond to the Symphony, which can be used to manipulate them in various ways.  Resonant Anemones  light up when a Washer Octopus is nearby. Lighting up all the Anemones in a location simultaneously will trigger an effect.   Xenochromatic Abilities [ ]   Special abilities can be obtained from  Xenochromatic Creatures  found underwater. A button will appear which allows the player to use the ability; hold it down to aim it.    The    Armored Crab  ability grants a shield and the ability to fire damaging shockwaves. Absorbing an attack with the shield aiming will increase the shockwave damage. This is the only way to defeat  Bullet Barnacles , and is useful for blocking  High-Pressure Water Vents  to position  Fantastical Floating Balls  in their corresponding rings.   The    Ball Octopus  allows the player to fire an energy beam which can damage enemies and manipulate certain objects. Unlike the other abilities, it can also be obtained and used on land by interacting with certain ecological research devices. The ability is particularly useful for:  Destroying the floating objects over  Contaminated Bacterial Mats  to remove them   Moving or merging  Dew Bubbles , used to trigger  Harmonious Reed Pipes   Spinning  Floating Crystal Flowers , causing Floating Crystal Platforms to appear   Moving  Humongous Hat Jellyfish , which can be used to launch the player into the air   Manipulating  Operable Mechanisms  to commandeer  Dangerous Autocannons , redirect  Energy Flows , and solve other puzzles   Launching  Potential Energy Orbs  into their targets when standing within a nearby golden sign   The    Blubberbeast  grants the ability to release waves of sonar that can detect significant objects as well as damage enemies.   The    Hunter's Ray  grants the ability to fire Fontemer Water Blades. As well as attacking enemies, it's also useful for cutting the glowing spots on  Fontemer Seagrass . Cut all the spots within a short time to release whatever is trapped by the seagrass.   The    Hat Jellyfish  grants the ability to throw a Bing-Bang Hat Bomb and remotely detonate it. This ability is particularly useful for destroying underwater rock piles,  Red Meanies , and  Strange Eels . The latter two, when found in groups, must be all destroyed within moments of each other or they will respawn.   Other [ ]   A  Beastly Rift  is a challenge where the player must defeat waves of    Riftwolves  while protecting several crystals.   Elynas Prisms  (unofficial name)  can be attacked to send an energy projection in the direction of the attack. Some Prisms can be moved, and some are inactive until struck by energy from another Prism. Some Prisms are covered with stone and must be struck by energy from another prism to remove the stone and trigger an effect.   Experimental Focusing Mirrors  are encountered during the  World Quest   Treacherous Light of the Depths . Each one can be used to relay a beam of light to eventually activate a device in the center of the ruins where they are found.     Hydroculi  can be offered at  Statues of the Seven  in Fontaine for rewards.   Collecting three  Hydrograna  will create a Hydro Core that continuously applies  Hydro  within an  Area of Effect  around the player for a short time. The effect can also be triggered with fewer Hydrograna by self-applying  Hydro .   Jadewater Fruit  are objects that can be damaged and eventually destroyed with  Elemental Reactions , releasing whatever is inside (usually a  Chest , a  Mora Chest , or an  Enemy ).   Looking Glasses  can teleport the player to and from certain locations in  ??? . Only the ones which glow purple are active and can teleport the player.   Optical Couplers  are found in the  Tower of Ipsissimus . During  World Quest  Series  In the Wake of Narcissus : Act II -  Savior's Wake , the player must rotate devices in the center of each room to align the couplers in order to proceed.   A  Water Volume Detection Crystal  can be activated by continually applying  Hydro  to it, triggering various effects.

[ ]             Screenshot from  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail       In the trailer  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail , under the title of the quest  Masquerade of the Guilty , there is a line written in Teyvat's  Latin script . It reads \" Iustitia omnia vincit \" which roughly means \"Justice conquers all,\" and is modified from the Latin phrase  labor omnia vincit .   Xingqiu 's novel,  A Legend of Sword , is extremely popular in Fontaine and  Inazuma . [6]   Yanfei , in one of her Voice-Overs, notes that Fontaine's legal system is notoriously complicated. [7]   The  Kamera  comes from Fontaine, as told by  Xu  when giving the  Snapshots  World Quest.   Midori  claims that Fontaine has an \"air-rail\" system that allows citizens to travel along the sky, as  Ramsay  wrote in his diary. However, there is no substantial evidence of this, and in the World Quest  International Travel Log , the player finds out that most of what Ramsay writes in his diary is fictional.   Rock 'n' roll originates from Fontaine. [8] [9]   All  Oceanids  are from Fontaine. They are loyal to the previous Hydro Archon,  Egeria , and allegedly left their native region because of the ideals of the new Hydro Archon,  Focalors .   In Vol. 2 of  Heart of Clear Springs , Fontaine is described as \"sapphire-blue.\"   Fontaine is currently the only nation that does not have any  One-Time Domains .   After Focalors' execution by the  Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale  and the destruction of the Hydro Archon's divine throne, Fontaine is currently the only region without an Archon, with the duties related to the Hydro Archon being instead passed to Neuvillette, the Hydro Dragon Sovereign.  This also makes Fontaine to be the first nation ruled by a Dragon Sovereign.   Etymology [ ]   Fontaine  means \"fountain\" in French, which is fitting for the home of the Hydro Archon.   The Chinese name for Fontaine,  枫丹 / 楓丹   Fēngdān , may be a clipping of \"Fontainebleau\" ( 枫丹白露 / 楓丹白露   Fēngdānbáilù ), a commune in the metropolitan area of Paris known for its castle sitting right by the water.   Cultural References [ ]   Given the nation's technology, its emphasis on \"true beauty and elegance,\" and the attire of its NPCs (e.g.  Caspar ), Fontaine may be partially inspired by the  Belle Époque , a period of French history in the late 19th century characterized by technological advancement and artistic flourishing.  Some of Fontaine's cultural elements seem to take inspiration from other cultures in and around France, such as  Basque ,  Corsican ,  Iberian  ,  Italian ,   Greek ,  English  cultures and  Western Europe  as a general.   Visually, Fontaine is inspired by the  Baroque  and  Art Deco  styles, while its geography is in part based on that of the  French Alps . [10]   Fontaine's theme as heard in the  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail  seems to be based on \"Aquarium,\" the seventh movement of  The Carnival of the Animals , a musical suite by the French  Romantic  composer  Camille Saint-Saëns .   Notes [ ]     ↑   The Hydro Archon's divine throne was destroyed along with Focalors during  Chapter IV . As a result, there will be no further Hydro Archons.  Neuvillette  has taken up the affairs related with the title.

On the far shore from sand and sea, the blazing epic hymn echoes through the land where the Sacred Flame blazes eternal. Beyond the fiery altars and the mysterious realm of night, an unprecedented adventure is about to unfold in the land where humans and Saurians dwell together. Land of Vibrant Stone and Flaming Springs: New Area Unlocked   Natlan is located beyond the west side of  Sumeru 's desert region, the  Great Red Sand , from the  Desert of Hadramaveth . It is also home to natural hot springs created from volcanic activity. [3] [4]  Its people are grouped into tribes, and each tribe follows different rules. [5]  During  Tenoch 's era 500 years ago, there were at least six major tribes in Natlan, of which all are extant by the time the Traveler arrives there. [6]   According to  Neuvillette ,  dragons  in Natlan, called  Saurians , have undergone long-term development and evolution with a large number of them coexisting with humanity. He also details that war is a constant in Natlan that ravages the land like an undying flame.  Il Capitano , the First of the  Eleven Fatui Harbingers , was also noted to be present in the region participating in the conflicts. [7]   According to  Ranjit , people in Natlan have a lot of reservations about leaving their homeland, but he doesn't feel comfortable talking about it as a foreigner. He does not believe it is due to a fear of unfamiliar environments. [8]  On the other hand,  Mavuika  states that the reason is due to the people's survival being tied with the  Wayob  against the  Abyss ; even if left with no choice, those departing Natlan must seek their tribal chief's approval with the Wayob in order to grant them leave.

Notable Features [ ]   Natlan features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards:    Saurian Indwelling [ ]   When approaching a Spiritsconce or adult Saurian enemies, the player can tap a button to temporarily \" indwell \" a Saurian. This allows the player to use the Saurian's special abilities which are useful for interacting with various exploration mechanics in Natlan. These abilities can also be performed by using the  Elemental Skills  of playable characters from the Saurian's associated tribe. Trainers found throughout Natlan can conduct  Warrior's Challenges  to test the player's skills in using these abilities.    Koholasaurs  can swim rapidly in water or  Liquid Phlogiston  without harm, perform high leaps at  Jet-Set Eddies , ride  Spiritways , and collect  Unveiling Scripts .   Tepetlisaurs  can move along most surfaces while burrowing, and even discover buried objects. Phlogiston crystals, which are normally unclimbable, can be ascended by a burrowing Tepetlisaur. They can also enter  Molten Fissures , which cause the Tepetlisaur to move while burrowed along a fixed path.   Yumkasaurs  can grab  Flamegranates ,  Relay Balls , or  Phlogiston Explosive Barrels  with their tongues, then shoot them at targets. Thrown Flamegranates can trigger explosions to damage enemies, destroy certain objects such as  cracked rocks . Their tongues can also use it to grapple objects and  Coilgrass Sigils  and pull  grappling hooks .   Nightsoul Abilities [ ]   Natlanese characters can enter the  Nightsoul's Blessing  state by using their  Elemental Skills , which increases their movement and combat abilities. Using these abilities consumes Nightsoul Points; once they are exhausted,  Phlogiston  is used instead. The abilities of indwelled  Saurians  behave in a similar fashion, as mentioned above.   Having a Natlanese character in the player's party causes a  Nightsoul Burst  to be triggered when any character in the part deals  Elemental   DMG  to an  enemy . Nightsoul Bursts may enhance character abilities through certain  Talents  or  Artifacts .   Within Natlan, during certain movement modes (sprinting, climbing, swimming, jumping), the player can seamlessly switch to another Natlanese character without having to exit the movement mode in question. This technique is called Nightsoul Transmission. The availability of this Nightsoul Transmission ability is indicated by the character's on-screen avatar lighting up.   Phlogiston [ ]   Phlogiston  is an advanced form of  Pyro  unique to Natlan. It can be collected by a variety of means throughout the nation, and can be used to power Nightsoul's Blessing and Saurian abilities. The amount of Phlogiston the player has available is displayed as a meter above the  HP  meter. Certain devices require the expenditure of Phlogiston to activate.   Phlogiston can also be found in the form of large solid crystals. These structures are not climbable by normal means, but can be ascended using the abilities of Tepetlisaurs or playable characters from the  Children of Echoes .   Liquid Phlogiston  is a hazard that rapidly depletes the player's  HP . Indwelling a Koholasaur or using the Elemental Skill of a playable character from the  People of the Springs  allows the player to traverse it safely.   Other [ ]   When collected, the  All-purifying Sacred Flame  can ignite certain braziers in Natlan.   Iridescent Beams  periodically fire on the player until they are touched.   Monetoos  are similar to  Seelies : following them back to ancient graffiti earns a reward.   Nightsoul Totems  lead to locations in the  Night Kingdom  to face trials against  Local Legends .   Pyro Sigils  can be collected and  offered  at the  Tablet of Tona  for rewards.     Pyroculi  can be offered at  Statues of the Seven  in Natlan for rewards.   Spores of Repose  can be used to create a temporary Leaf of Repose in mid-air to stand on, similar to the ones created when grappling Coilgrass Sigils.   Tribal Secret Spaces  can be unlocked using Obsidian Rings which are assembled from fragments found in  Precious  and  Luxurious Chests  in Natlan. Each tribe's space requires a separate ring in a unique color:  azure ,  green , and  yellow .   Unstable Phlogiston Crystals  explode after a short delay when the player gets close. Some of them are located underground and can only be sensed by the special abilities of Tepetlisaurs or playable characters from the Children of Echoes.   The  World Quest   Revelations from the Past  in Series  Between Pledge and Forgettance  has  Void Barriers  that act as shields that protect targets until the barrier is destroyed by  Elemental  attacks, especially ones delivered while in the Nightsoul's Blessing state. The quest also allows the player to  take control  of  Little One  to help solve some puzzles.   Many enemies unique to Natlan (including  Saurians ) that become aware of the player's presence do not immediately become  aggravated . Indwelling a Saurian allows the player to approach other Saurians without aggravating them at all unless the player attacks, or aggravates a nearby non-Saurian.

It reads \" Surge vir fortis i natam victoriam \" roughly meaning \"Rise, O strong man, and go to your destined victory.\"   Natlan is the last of the seven regions to be directly mentioned in-game and the only region that does not have any NPCs from the nation prior to its version of release. It was first mentioned by name in  Version 2.0  through  Tingting ,  Aikawa Susumu , and  Mikawa Akane 's dialogues.  All other nations have some of their NPCs revealed in  Version 1.0 .   Two bathhouse NPCs in  Inazuma ,  Mikawa Akane  in  Tenshukaku  and  Aikawa Susumu  in  Tenryou , mention that Natlan contains hot-springs created from volcanic activity. As Inazuma does not have natural volcanic hot springs,  Snezhnaya  lent the Royal Bath Commission a device which would create artificial ones.   Shousen  mentions that the people of Natlan practice  shadowboxing .   A sailor in  Romaritime Harbor ,  Lectoure , mentions that there are a few different tribes with different rules in Natlan.   Adel , an NPC located in the  Bayda Harbor , speaks very highly of the place, stating that its population is energetic and that \"their souls are forged for battle from birth\", that they love street graffiti, showing off and comparing fashionable trinkets. He also states it's a \"contradictory, charming and colorful\" place.   Ranjit mentions that the people there, especially the warriors, dress in imitation of their Saurians. [10]   The  Natlan Preview Teaser  video was the first regional preview teaser not to reveal the new characters' names.  Kachina ,  Mualani  and  Kinich  appeared, but were not named until  Ignition Teaser: A Name Forged in Flames .  Fauna unique to Natlan was also shown in the Natlan Preview Teaser. A cervid or deer-like animal, as well as a sauropod-like animal were briefly shown.   Etymology [ ]   Natlan's name likely derives from  Aztlán , the legendary homeland of the  Aztecs .   Natlan's name is likely structured of the noun \"Na\" and the suffix  -tlan  which is a locative suffix to denote adjacency, distance below or to describe abundance in Classical  Nahuatl .   Cultural References [ ]   Natlan appears to be inspired by several indigenous cultures, primarily those of  Pre-Columbian   Latin America ,  Sub-Saharan Africa , and  Oceania , as well as minor influences, such as from the  American Southwest .  The names of Natlan's tribes derive from the  Thirteen Heavens  of  Nahua  cosmology.   The names of  Tenoch 's fighting companions, as mentioned in the  Talking Stick  lore, are of  Kenyan ,  Ethiopian ,  Amazigh ,  Burkinabè ,  Malian  and  Inca  origin, respectively.   The names of characters from  Ignition Teaser: A Name Forged in Flames  also come from the languages and cultures of  Hopi  ( Pueblo ),  Yucatec  ( Maya ),  Hawaiian ,  Yoruba ,  Nahua , and  Māori   A book titled  An Environmental History of Latin America  can be seen on a developer's desk during the 4.4 Special Program. [11]   The music in the  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail  includes guitar and  castanets , which are often heard in traditional Latin music.   The music played in the first preview teaser includes  balafon  and  fula flutes , which are often heard in  West African  music. [12]   Music in the second preview teaser included a  didgeridoo , a well-known traditional Aboriginal instrument. [13]   Natlan's graffiti is probably inspired by the  City of São Paulo , as Dawei said in  5.0 livestream  that they have visited the city for inspirations. The city is known as \"Grafitti’s World Capital\" because the amount of street graffiti.   The terrain of Natlan as seen in the various promotional material are modeled after landscapes such as  horst and grabens  and  mesas . These are similar to various African and South American canyons and landscapes, such as the  Chapada Diamantina ,  Monte Roraima , and  the Blyde River Canyon .  The local flora resembles features  savannahs , with  baobabs  and  acacias  being common trees.

Our people's survival is inextricably tied to the Wayob. Mavuika:  But, their power has its limits. They cannot offer our people the same degree of protection outside our borders. In fact, people who do decide to leave often suffer from memory loss and emotional issues. Mavuika:  Everyone in Natlan understands this. That's why our people never leave without a good cause. Even if someone is left with no choice, the chief of their tribe must seek approval with the Wayob to grant them leave. Mavuika:   The Wayob have always been very strict about granting that approval, since extending protection beyond our borders means consuming power reserved for our fight against the Abyss.     ↑   Event  Specially-Shaped Saurian Search  World Quest, Part 1:  Search Chronicle: Burning Up!     ↑   YouTube:  Version 4.4 Special Program .     ↑   YouTube:  Natlan Preview Teaser - Saurian Wanderings .     ↑   YouTube:  Natlan Preview Teaser - Need a Hand?

Dainsleif , Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail [3]     Snezhnaya  ( Russian :  Снежная   Snezhnaya ) is one of the seven regions of  Teyvat . It is the nation that worships the  Tsaritsa , the  Cryo   Archon . The  Fatui , a military force under her control, is particularly notorious for their diehard devotion and their unscrupulous methods in enacting her will.  Archon Quest   Chapter VI  takes place in this region.

Childe  claims that people would literally freeze to death if they didn't keep moving outside. At night, the Snezhnayan sky can see a beautiful aurora of dancing light. [4]   Technologically, Snezhnaya is much more advanced than the other regions on Teyvat.  Venti  states that the Fatui are the strongest out of the seven regions' military, which is supported by the fact that all of their known fighting members utilize elemental attacks. The description for  Agent's Sacrificial Knife  calls it a \"weapon made with superior Snezhnayan technology.\" The  Fatui Skirmishers  wear mechanical suits of varying degrees, and some of its members use guns and cannons in battle.  Alice , who has visited Snezhnaya, recalls seeing massive factories, which she wrote down in her  Teyvat Travel Guide , and  Il Dottore  built a factory in  Liyue  to conduct  Ruin Guard  research which is fully automated. [5]   The  Adventurers' Guild  originates from Snezhnaya; [6]  while this fact doesn't seem to be a secret, few people comment on it and the Guild doesn't face the same apprehension that people regard the Fatui with. It was also hinted that  Katheryne , the receptionist(s) for the Adventurers' Guild, are a series of androids created for the role: the Katherynes in all regions so far are identical, and have \"Error...\" and \"Rebooting...\" idle quotes. This is further emphasized by the Katheryne stationed in Liyue, as she side-steps the Traveler questioning about her identity. Katheryne's identity as a \"bionic Snezhnayan puppet\" was confirmed by  Nahida . [7]     Locations [ ]       Name    Description      Zapolyarny Palace     The place where the Tsaritsa resides.

Trivia [ ]             Screenshot from  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail       In the trailer  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail , under the title of the quest  Everwinter Without Mercy , there is a line written in Teyvat's  Latin script . It reads \" Ducam regina mea gloria haud pluribus impar \" roughly meaning \"Let me lead my queen to near unmatched glory.\"  The last part of the sentence is likely modified from  nec pluribus impar  a Latin motto adopted by Louis XIV of France.   It is by far the longest of the seven phrases written in the Latin script in the video.   Tartaglia's flashback in his character demo shows Dragonspine rather than Snezhnaya, likely because Snezhnaya has not been modeled yet.  When the trailer was released, Dragonspine was not accessible yet.   Official art was released with  Tartaglia  and  Teucer  for the Eastern Slavic holiday  Maslenitsa  (also known as Butter Lady, Butter Week, Crepe Week, or Cheesefare Week). It is possible that a holiday inspired by it is celebrated in Snezhnaya.   Etymology [ ]   \"Snezhnaya\" ( Russian :  Снежная   Snezhnaya , \"Snowy\" )) is a Russian adjective for \"snowy,\" expecting a feminine noun to follow (most likely  Страна   Strana  or  Земля   Zemlya  — Russian words for \"country\" or \"land\" respectively, both of which are feminine and are permitted to be omitted for a synecdoche in such a context). The game's voiceover places the accent on the second syllable (Snezh- na -ya); however, in the original word, it's on the first ( Snezh -na-ya).  During the first Closed Beta Test, Snezhnaya was instead named \"Prekrasnaya\" ( Прекрасная   Prekrasnaya , \"Beautiful\" ). [9]   Snezhnaya's Chinese name,  至冬   Zhìdōng , is an anagram of the Chinese term for  winter solstice  ( 冬至   Dōngzhì ).   \"Zapolyarny\" ( Russian :  Заполярный   Zapolyarnyy , \"Polar\" ) roughly translates to \"beyond the arctic circle\" or \"inside the polar region.\"   \"Morepesok\" ( Russian :  Морепесок   Morepesok , \"Sea-Sand\" ) is a compound of the words for  море   more , \"sea\"  and  песок   pesok , \"sand,\"  itself referring to a beach or coastline as a sort of kenning.   \"Tsaritsa\" ( Russian :  Царица   Tsaritsa , \"Empress\" ), used to refer to their Archon, is the feminine form of  Tsar , which ultimately derives from Caesar, a title of Roman emperors. So far, no one has called her by her true name; Snezhnayans call her by her title, while  Venti  and  Zhongli  call her \"the Cryo Archon.\"   Cultural References [ ]   Snezhnaya seems to be inspired by a mix of Tsarist and Soviet Russia (primarily Siberia in regards to landscape), and often uses Russian words for names. However, it also draws from other European nations as well, such as using Italian  commedia dell'arte  stock characters' names for the Harbingers.   Snezhnaya's affiliation with brutal winters parallels Russia's climate, which has famously contributed to the failures of the  many  military campaigns made against it.   Tartaglia  addresses the Traveler as \"comrade\" in his  voice-overs , the usual translation of \"tovarishch\" ( Russian :  товарищ   tovarishch ) used in Soviet/Bolshevik Russia.  In the Japanese version of Childe's Character Miscellany, he starts off his letter (\"Dearest sister...\") in Russian. [10]   Fire-Water ( Russian :  огненная вода   ognennaya voda , \"fiery water\" ), which  Angel's Share  bartender  Charles  deems the strongest wine he knows of, originates from Snezhnaya. It is a reference to the liquor  vodka , a drink commonly associated with Russia. In real life Russian Vodka is normally 45-55% Ethanol and some Vodkas are more than 80% Ethanol, making Vodka one of the most alcoholic drinks in the world.

It was a powerful nation, built purely by humans, an unprecedented flourishing and glorious civilization — it was the pride of humankind. Dainsleif , \" A Herald Without Adherents \"     Khaenri'ah , also known as the  Kingdom of Khaenri'ah  or  Dahri , is a region that is not part of the continent of  Teyvat  and is not under the purview of  The Seven .  Khaenri'ah is most importantly known for its role in the \" cataclysm \" 500 years ago. During this time, monsters created by the alchemist  Rhinedottir , also known as \"Gold,\" poured out from Khaenri'ah to invade Teyvat, and Khaenri'ah was eventually destroyed by  Celestia  and the gods. Afterwards, all Khaenri'ahns who were not \"pure-blooded\" were turned into monsters, whereas all \"pure-blooded\" Khaenri'ahns were cursed with immortality. [4]   Despite its destruction and the transformation of many of its people into monsters, some Khaenri'ahns are still wandering through Teyvat.  Dainsleif  — a denizen of Khaenri'ah and the narrator of  Travail  — describes it as one of \"the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall,\" and says that its people \"dream of dreaming,\" unlike the majority who are \"content to live, and not to dream.\" [5]   According to  Kaeya , it is said that Khaenri'ah is located deep underground somewhere near  Sumeru . [6]  The Khaenri'ahn installation known as  Hangeh Afrasiyab  guards a giant, tightly sealed stone gate beneath it that most likely leads to Khaenri'ah.

But in the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall, there are those who dream of dreaming. Some say a few are chosen and the rest are dregs, but I say we humans have our humanity. We will defy this world with a power from beyond. — Dainsleif , Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail [5]   Khaenri'ah is dark underground and mostly barren of natural life. What little is currently known about Khaenri'ah largely comes from weapon and artifact descriptions, as well as books found throughout the world. According to  Dainsleif , it is the \"pride of humanity\", as it was built purely by humans without involvement from any god, until later it was destroyed by the gods 500 years ago. [8]   The practice of the  Art of Khemia [9]  and the use of  forbidden knowledge [10]  led to the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah's ruin. Around 500 years ago,  King Irmin  introduced forbidden knowledge to enhance the kingdom's technological advancement. The alchemist  Rhinedottir  also used it in her experiments to develop powerful creatures containing the power of the  Abyss , including  Durin ,  Elynas , and the  Riftwolves . For some reason, these creatures began wreaking havoc throughout Khaenri'ah and then spilled out into the rest of  Teyvat . [11]   In response, [12]  the gods of  Celestia , with the help of six of The Seven, [13]  launched an assault on Khaenri'ah. The skies turned red and filled with crimson cubes (possibly the work of the  Unknown God ), and the landmass the kingdom was built on was torn to pieces, with lava flooding the shattered fragments of it. [14]  While the gods were victorious, at least two of The Seven — the Hydro Archon  Egeria  and the Electro Archon  Raiden Makoto [15]  — were killed. A third Archon,  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata  died after mostly purifying the surge of forbidden knowledge that contaminated  Irminsul  and creating her successor,  Lesser Lord Kusanali , from the tree's purest branch. [16]   Mondstadt 's  Knights of Favonius , then led by Grand Master  Arundolyn , led an expedition into Khaenri'ah to quell the monsters. His best friend and rival,  Rostam , fell in battle during the cataclysm, leaving Arundolyn greatly bereaved. Other notable figures who are known for fighting against the monsters include  Viridescent  and the  Crimson Witch of Flames . While the initial surge of monsters was eventually suppressed, hilichurls continue to spawn throughout Teyvat.  In the present, Khaenri'ah continues its struggle against the effects of the curse.  Kaeya , their \"last hope,\" was sent to Mondstadt for the sake of an \"ancient plot,\" infiltrating the  Ragnvindr Clan  by being abandoned at the  Dawn Winery . [17] [18]  The ultimate reason behind Kaeya being placed as a \"sleeper\" in Mondstadt by forces from Khaenri'ah is unknown.    Abyss Order [ ]   Main article:  Abyss Order   The Abyss Order originates from the destruction of Khaenri'ah by the gods; [8]  it seeks to destroy the countries under the protection of  The Seven  in revenge. [19]  The people of Khaenri'ah turned into the monsters of the Abyss. [20]  Thus, it is thought that  Abyss Mages ,  Abyss Heralds , and  Abyss Lectors  were once people from Khaenri'ah, possibly its aristocracy and knights / defending people.    Art of Khemia [ ]   Main article:  Art of Khemia   Khaenri'ah was an underground realm, and its natural fauna were few indeed. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life. This art of creation was known as \"The Art of Khemia.\" — Albedo ,  Character Story 5   The Art of Khemia is an advanced type of  alchemy  developed in Khaenri'ah which allows for the creation of life itself. [21]  Five hundred years ago, the Art of Khemia was a major contributing factor behind the  cataclysm  and the fall of Khaenri'ah. [9] [22]   The only known practitioners of the Art of Khemia are  Rhinedottir  and  Albedo , her student and successful attempt to create a synthetic human.    Automatons [ ]   Main article:  Automatons   Ruin Machines  were made as weapons of war by the people of Khaenri'ah. The most common type,  Ruin Guards , were code-named \"Field Tillers\" by the people of Khaenri'ah. After the nation's downfall, the machines migrated across Teyvat. Though dangerous, they now lack any planned purpose. [8]     Khaenri'ahns [ ]   The people of Khaenri'ah were changed into creatures of the  Abyss  in the cataclysm that destroyed the dynasty 500 years as a result of the curse. However, pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were instead given a curse of immortality, preventing them from aging but still suffering from apparent  erosion . The others, who hailed from the lands of the gods, were instead transformed into various creatures; a majority turned into  hilichurls , but others instead appeared to turn into Abyss mages, heralds or lectors. The royal guard of Khaenri'ah,  The Black Serpents , were instead eroded into either Shadowy Husks or still remained as the Black Serpents, but with a different form and suffering from erosion. The erosion was not complete, as some hilichurls were aware of the powers of a fountain in the Chasm and went there to \"die\" peacefully, while  Halfdan  and his subordinates remembered their duties to protect the people of Khaenri'ah. [20] [23]   Kaeya 's family, the  Alberich Clan , were the Regents of Khaenri'ah after the cataclysm. It is unclear the number of generations between Kaeya and the Catalysm. It is also unclear why Kaeya is unaffected by the curse.  Other persons associated with the state include  Pierro , Capitano, [24] [25]   Rhinedottir , and possibly  Albedo  and  Arlecchino  by extension.

Trivia [ ]             Screenshot from  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail       In the trailer  Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail , unlike the  Seven Nations  who each have a line written in Teyvat's  Latin script , there is nothing under the title of its featured quest  The Dream Yet to Be Dreamed .   Jean 's  Voice-Overs  mention a legend of a \"heroic king of Khaenri'ah,\" which she offers to tell the  Traveler  about.   The Eclipse Dynasty was previously translated as the Blacksun Dynasty.   In the story told in the description of  Bloodstained Final Hour , the  Bloodstained Knight  ventures into the Abyss, which he discovers was once a kingdom, those inhabitants were turned into monsters by a curse. A direct link with Khaenri'ah is not made though it could be speculated that the two are actually the same.   It is unclear if the term Khemia is just a synonym for Alchemy, or a more advanced art.   A hilichurl tribe called the Eclipse tribe seems to be related to Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty. [26]   The Traveler seems to know something about the Eclipse symbol used by the Eclipse tribe. [27]   Although it has been stated that Khaenri'ah's downfall was caused by the  Heavenly Principles [28]  and that  The Seven , with the exception of  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata , were summoned to Khaenri'ah, [16]  it is unknown if The Seven were directly involved in its destruction or not.   Characters of Khaenri'ahn descent, such as Kaeya and Dainsleif, are typically depicted with pupils in the shape of  four-pointed stars .   A door with the Khaenri'ah crest can be found in the depths of  Hangeh Afrasiyab , though it cannot be currently interacted with in any way.   Etymology [ ]   Khemia is phonetically similar to several etymological origins for the modern terms  alchemy  and  chemistry . The origin of these terms are uncertain and multiple derivations exist. [29]   One possible derivation is from the Arabic  كيمياء   kīmiyāʾ , \"chemistry\" , which comes from Coptic term  ⲕⲏⲙⲉ   kēme , \"Egypt\" . The Coptic term ultimately derives from the ancient Egyptian word  𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖   kmt , referring to both the country Egypt and the color black.   Other possible derivations are from the Ancient Greek  χημεία   khēmeía  meaning \"pouring\" or \"infusion,\" or the Ancient Greek metallurgical term  χυμεία   khumeía  originally meaning \"pouring together,\" \"casting together,\" \"weld,\" or \"alloy.\"   In Arabic, \"alchemy\" translates to  خيمياء   ḵīmiyāʾ .   In  Sumeru ,  Dahri  is an archaic name for Khaenri'ah that's commonly used in the  Vahumana   Darshan . [30]  The Arabic-Persian word \"dahri\" ( Arabic :  دَهْرِيّ   dahriyy ;  Persian :  دهری   dahrī ), derived from  dahr  ( Arabic-Persian:   دَهْر  \"the course of time, fate\" ), is a theological term which refers to an atheist, or an adherent of the doctrine that the universe has no beginning in time. The term has been used in different ways in Middle Persian and Islamic writings, but generally,  dahri  deny the existence of a creator god and believe that the world exists eternally in time. [31]   Cultural References [ ]   Several elements of Khaenri'ah are most likely inspired by the  Germanic legends , particularly the  Nibelungen song .  Most characters related to Khaenri'ah are named after Germanic/Norse myth and literature:  Dainsleif  —  the name of a legendary sword   Alberich ( Kaeya 's surname) —  the name of a dwarven king , also appearing in Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelungen opera.   Durin  and  Dvalin  —  the names of two dwarven smiths   Surtalogi  — is the name of the bright sword or flame wielded by the  Fire Jotunn Surtr from Norse Mythology .   Hroptatyr  — is one of the  names of Odin , meaning \"sage\".   Rhinedottir  — a  character from Wagner's opera based on the Germanic mythology .   Rerir  — is a  powerful ruler  in Germanic mythology that murders his father and is the ancestor of the  Völsung clan.   In Norse mythology  Vedrfolnir  — is a  hawk  sitting between the eyes of an unnamed eagle perched atop the world tree Yggdrasil.   The Viking Age Norse equivalent for  Irmin  — is Jörmunr, which is used in the  Poetic Edda  as an epithet for the Norse god  Odin .   The battle between gods and god-like powers caused a catastrophe onto the world, and  Abyss Heralds  still preaches the burning and the end of the world. The concept resembles the event in the Norse mythology called \"Fate of the Gods\" ( Old Norse :  Ragnarök ) or \"Twilight of the Gods\" ( German :  Götterdämmerung ) in the Nibelungen song. The title of Dainsleif — \"Twilight Sword\" — shares a similar wording.   Khaenri'ah's motto, \"The land is [...] to be fought for with steel and blood\", [8]   is likely to be a reference to \"with iron and blood\" ( German :  durch Eisen und Blut ), a famous phrase used during the  Blood and Iron Speech  made by the Prussian minister president  Otto von Bismarck  in 1862.  While the English version uses the wording \"with steel and blood\", the Chinese one uses \"with iron and blood\" ( Chinese :  用铁和血 ) that exactly matches the wording of the historical speech.

Typically, the full glyph is used, however in some cases, only half of the glyph is shown or only half of the glyph is relevant.    The event menu for  Unreconciled Stars  uses only the bottom half of the glyphs.   Text under \" Unknown Star \":  somnia  (\"dreams\") Text under \" Star of Deceitful Dreams \":  ierunt  (\"they have gone\") Text under \" Star of Destiny \":  caelum  (\"sky\")   In the quest  A Herald Without Adherents , two lines of text use only the top half of the glyphs, with one being inverted.   Fatae parcae  ( fatae ,  parcae ) Fati textrix  (inverted; \"the weaver of fate\")   In the  secret messages  found in  The Chasm: Underground Mines , only the bottom half of the glyphs should be read: [Note 1]   Vivos voco  (\"I call the living\") Mortuos plango  (\"I mourn for the dead\")   Notes [ ]     ↑   The top half of the glyph is changed systematically. Specifically, the alphabet is divided into five-letter sets (with six letters for the last set) and first letter of the set uses an inverted top half of the last letter of the set, the second letter of the set uses an inverted top half of the second-last letter of the set, and so on. This results in, for example, the letters A, B, C, D, and E having an inverted top half of the letters E, D, C, B, and A for their top halves respectively, while the bottom halves remain the same.

It is unknown if hilichurls have a writing system for their language.    Hilichurlian isn't well understood in  Teyvat  as few people are interested in hilichurls; According to  Ella Musk , Hilichurlian Linguistics is an underdeveloped academic field. Due to the risk of humans interacting with hilichurls, its study is limited by the researcher's ability to complete field work. [1]  Due to this, the study of Hilichurlian Linguistics is predominantly driven by Ella Musk's ongoing research and that of her ancestor — most likely her grandfather —  Jacob Musk . Jacob Musk was described as the \"Poet Laureate\" of Hilichurlian for his book,  Hilichurl Ballad Selection , an accolade he was not fond of. [2]  Ella Musk introduces her self as a professor of Hilichurlian Linguistics specializing in \"applied grammar for vernacular Hilichurlian.\" [1]   Materials on the language of the hilichurls are scarce and most are written by the same small group of scholars — Jacob Musk and Ella Musk. Additionally, as both were based in Mondstadt, much of their research has been only on the hilichurl tribes local to the region. Their attempts to understand Hilichulian language and customs has had mixed results. Ella Musk admits that without more field work, she is uncertain of the meaning behind several words. [1]  During Ella Musk's commissions,  the Traveler  attempts to speak Hilichurlian with varying degrees of success depending on the player's choices. If the player selects the correct words, the hilichurls respond with dancing. If an incorrect word is selected, they grow aggressive leading immediately to a fight. [3] [4]  Before  Mika  joined the  Knights of Favonius  as a cartographer, he went with Ella Musk on one of her \"language exchange\" trips to get some expedition practice. While conversing with a hilichurl, Ella Musk made a mistake which ended in both of them getting beat up. [5]   Kaeya  and  Venti  have been observed to hold some level of proficiency in Hilichulian, but it is unknown how or when they studied the language. [6]  Venti claims to have learned it to help with his songwriting, but states he hasn't actually written any ballads in Hilichurlian. [7]  The Traveler also exercises their Hilichurlian during  Lionfang's Legacy,  the third part of Venti's Story Quest  Carmen Dei Chapter : Act I -  Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land .   Hilichurls \"across the continent\" have been observed singing. [2]   Abyss mages can speak Hilichurlian.      Translation [ ]   Real world attempts to decipher the language of the Hilichurls have been made using a combination of sources including the official  manga , books such as  Hilichurl Ballad Selection ,  Hilichurl Cultural Customs , and Ella Musk's commissions. Hilichurlian is the most understood distinct language of Teyvat. Unlike most other languages in Teyvat, which are real life languages such as English and Latin written with a custom alphabet, Hilichurlian is a  constructed language  and is therefore linguistically distinct, with distinct phonology, words, phrases, and grammar.  A key part of understanding the language comes from the second episode of the official Chinese livestream \"Mondstadt Tea Party,\" which gives two translated phrases:  Mosi mita  and  Mosi gusha , which literally mean \"eat meat\" and \"eat vegetables\" respectively, and are used figuratively as expressions of happiness and sadness, respectively. [8] [9]   A major source of information on Hilichurlian is the  Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian  (HHH), written by Ella Musk's grandfather. The HHH can be treated as generally correct as the Traveler will not run into issues when using the HHH as a guide. However, it may have dubious accuracy when it comes to the exact nuances of Hilichurlian due to Ella's own errors in the language as well as any errors in understanding that the original author had.

Some speakers may pronounce the graphemes ⟨a⟩ and ⟨e⟩ as both /æ/. Voiced consonants may sometimes be pronounced with tenuis consonants instead.  The mid central vowel, /ə/, although present in Hilichurlian, is not very common. It only appears as the rendition of the grapheme ⟨o⟩ in special cases. ⟨o⟩ is normally pronounced as /ʌ/. For example, the word  movo  is pronounced with /ə/ in the first ⟨o⟩ and the regular reading of /ʌ/ in the second ⟨o⟩.        Official Transcription    Voice-Over      Odomu Movo! [18]     https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:Vo_eqxs003_3_hilichurls_02.ogg     Hilichurlian does not appear to have diphthongs. In words where vowels are adjacent to each other, such as  biadam , hiatus is employed instead and ⟨bi⟩ and ⟨a⟩ are considered separate morae.        Official Transcription    Voice-Over      Biadam! [16]     https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/File:Vo_wdlq003_8_hilichurls_01.wem.ogg     Morphosyntactic Alignment [ ]   Hilichurlian is generally an  ergative-absolutive  language, however it does not purely abide by the rules of ergative-absolutive morphosyntactic alignment.  One main example is the interrogative mood of a transitive verb; in a classical ergative-absolutive language, the agent of a transitive verb is always the ergative, and never the absolutive. However, in Hilichurlian, when a transitive verb takes the interrogative  dala  as the object, the agent must be marked in absolutive case. For example,  ye muhe dala?  instead of  yo muhe dala?   The following table lists ergative-absolutive pairs.        Pronoun    Ergative    Absolutive      First-person    mi    mi      First-person plural    mimi    mimi      Second-person    yo    ye      Second-person plural    yoyo    yeye    Orthography [ ]   Hilichurlian is written with the Latin alphabet, however it is unclear if the Hilichurls write Hilichurlian themselves or if the orthography was simply developed by humans such as  Jacob Musk  to transcribe the sounds of Hilichurlian.  Hilichurlian is observed to not use the letters  f ,  j ,  q , and  x . Therefore, the Hilichurlian alphabet contains 22 letters: 5 vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and 17 consonants.      A a   B b   C c   D d   E e   G g   H h   I i   K k   L l   M m   N n   O o   P p   R r   S s   T t   U u   V v   W w   Y y   Z z     Pluralization [ ]   In Hilichurlian, nouns and pronouns are abstractly pluralized through reduplication. The first-person singular pronoun  mi  is reduplicated to become the first-person plural pronoun  mimi .    Verbs [ ]   In Hilichurlian, verbs are not inflectionally distinguished from nouns or adjectives. A verb as a headword can be used as a noun and adjective too in some cases. They do not inflect or conjugate, but have some main constructions.  Hilichurlian is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language, like English and Chinese. The direct object is placed directly after the verb, and the subject precedes the verb.  Hilichurlian does not have definite or indefinite articles, much like Chinese or Japanese.        SUBJECT     VERB     OBJECT       Mi     muhe     ye.       I -erg     like or  win (over)    you -abs .        SUBJECT     VERB     OBJECT       Yoyo     zido     ika.       You (plural) -erg     fight or  kill    (the) enemy -abs .        SUBJECT     VERB     OBJECT       Ye     muhe     dala?       You -abs     want or  like    what? -abs       What do you want/like?     However, the locative case is marked by placing the location prior to an intransitive movement verb.        qualifier     SUBJECT     locative     VERB       Kuzi     Unu     ya     zido.       Mighty    Unu -erg  [a god]    (the) human -abs-loc     goes (to)      The mighty Unu goes to the human.     Hilichurlian has  9 grammatical moods  in a total of  2 grammatical mood categories :    Realis  ( real )  Declarative  ( decl ). This mood is used to declare that something is the case.   Negative  ( neg ). This mood is used to encode negative (non-affirmative) polarity into an utterance.   Immediate  ( imm ). This mood is used to signify that a verb is being performed in the immediate present.   Emphatic  ( emp ). This mood is used to stress and emphasize a verb.   Irrealis  ( irr )  Deotonic  ( deo )  Imperative  ( imp ). This mood is used to directly issue commands to a second party listener.   Optative  ( opt ).

The event name in Chinese includes a term ( 折箭 ) that can mean  alliance  (lit. to break an arrow [to seal a promise]), and the event names in both Japanese and Korean use the word for  alliance  ( 結盟  and  同 盟 , respectively). Discussed in a comment on  Hilichurlian  and the wiki's Discord server's #wiki-suggestions and #genshin-languages channels at the beginning of June 2021.     ↑   The glide /j/ is not present in front of the vowel /i/.     ↑   Homu  is a name referenced by the  Unusual Hilichurl  and not a word. It is a reference to the mascot in previous games of HoYoverse.       Trivia [ ]   Based on the proposed translations,  Ella Musk  sometimes says something completely different from what she intends to, especially in dialogue lines available since before the event  Mimi Tomo .   Some of the translations of Hilichurlian were based on the Chinese equivalents provided during an official voice actor livestream. [10]   Olah! Mosi mita! Mosi gusha!   In the official voice actor livestream, Jean's voice actor says that their information comes from Ella Musk, who also approves of their plans to give Hilichurlian lessons. [19]  It's unlikely that this interaction is canon since Jean's voice actor says this as herself, the voice actor in real life. However, it is still noteworthy that the information is presented as information from Ella Musk rather than from anyone in real life who worked on Hilichurlian.

Liyue Script           Example of the Liyue script.       Type   Languages       The  Liyue Script  ( unofficial name ) refers to the writing system of  Liyue .  The script is inspired by real-life Chinese characters, particularly  seal script . Such script is common in  Liyue Harbor  around shops and other businesses — there is a very high degree of repetition of these symbols between shop signs. [Note 1]  Other examples of this script can be seen on the  Jade Chamber  Intel Wall during the animated cutscene in the  Archon Quest   Zhongli's Treat  in  Chapter I : Act II -  Farewell, Archaic Lord  and on bulletin boards around Liyue.

A stylized (or ancient) form of the Liyue script appears in  Beneath the Dragon-Queller  on the ground around the seal after  Azhdaha  is defeated.    The script on the ground around the seal after defeating  Azhdaha .   Deciphered Characters [ ]   There are few instances where characters in this script that have been deciphered and determined to be based on existing Chinese characters. In most cases, the characters closely correspond to  seal script , an ancient form of the Chinese writing system.  A few characters appear in the center of the seal at the entrance to  Beneath the Dragon-Queller . They are used to indicate which element Azhdaha will be  infused  with and are based on the Chinese seal script of these Elements:  Electro  ( 雷 ),  Hydro  ( 水 ),  Cryo  ( 冰 ), and  Pyro  ( 火 ). Note that the character for Electro has been simplified from its seal script form ( 靁 ) by replacing the  畾  portion with the symbol for Electro  .  Four characters also appear when  Yanfei 's  Charged Attack  leaves an impression on the ground. These characters have been interpreted to be based on the Chinese glyphs for  福  \"blessing,\"   祿  \"prosperity,\"   商  \"business,\"  and  印  \"seal\" or \"stamp\"  (right to left, top to bottom). [1]  The symbol identified as  印  is in fact identical to one seal script form of the character, while the other characters seem to be highly stylized. [Note 2]   There is also another Chinese character found in the game, which is the one on the  Unusual Hilichurl 's mask. This character is  伟  \"Wei,\"  the name of the CEO of  MiHoYo . This character, however, does not seem to be in the same style of script.    The Element symbols for the domain Beneath the Dragon-Queller. From left to right:  Electro ,  Hydro ,  Cryo , and  Pyro .

Notable exceptions are the last symbol on the banner for Wanmin Restaurant, and the symbols for Wanwen Bookstore.     ↑   The symbol identified as  印  has not been seen in the game prior to Yanfei's release. The three other characters appear throughout Liyue.

    "Inazuman_Script": "  Inazuman Script           The Inazuman script       Type   Languages       The  Inazuman Script  ( unofficial name ) refers to the writing system of  Inazuma .  The script is based on the Teyvat alphabet [1]  and appears to be inspired by  Japanese   hiragana . It can be found written vertically from top-to-bottom, right-to-left, as with various traditional East Asian scripts, or it can be written horizontally. The glyphs used in the Inazuma script correspond to letters of the  Latin  alphabet instead of Japanese  kana . The texts written in this script are based on  romanized  Japanese.    Contents     1   Deciphering   2   Example Texts   3   References   4   Navigation       Deciphering [ ]   While the Inazuman alphabet is used to represent romanized Japanese, in most cases, the Inazuman text does not correspond directly to each letter of the romaji. Typically, only the first letter of each syllable is rendered in Inazuman. Therefore, all syllables that start with the same consonant are typically rendered the same. For example,  か ,  き ,  く ,  け , and  こ  ( ka ,  ki ,  ku ,  ke , and  ko ) would all be written as the Inazuman symbol for \"K\"  (よ ⇁ ) . There is a large variation in which other letters are rendered. Voicing is sometimes ignored, such that  て  ( te ) may be written with the symbol of \"D\" instead. Long vowels and  ん  ( n ) are sometimes omitted. The letters in consonant digraphs such as  sh ,  ch , and  ts  are sometimes both written. Further complicating matters, in longer texts which correspond to Japanese, some Inazuman symbols which would normally not be expected in romanized Japanese such as \"L,\" \"V,\" or \"X\" show up and may actually represent other sounds instead. This ambiguity and variation makes it difficult to decipher Inazuman texts, especially without context.

Vedanagari script is used in  Sumeru City : In the letter, Alhaitham states that  Isak 's rapidly developing skill at reading and writing the Vedanagari script has led him to receive primers from  Sumeru Akademiya , and the Chinese name for Vedanagari includes the term  学城   xuéchéng , \"academic city,\"  which has been used several times to describe Sumeru City. (The English localization translates the term in various ways, including \"academy city\" [1]  and \"City of Wisdom.\" [2] )   This script borrows visual features of the real-world Devanagari script, most recognizably the horizontal line that runs along the top of letters. Meanwhile, the name  Vedanagari  closely parallels  Devanagari  in both the English localization and the original Chinese term:  Vedanagari  is a compound of Sanskrit  वेद   veda , \"knowledge\"  and  नागरी   nāgarī , \"[script] of the city.\"   Devanagari  is a compound of Sanskrit  देव   deva , \"deity, divine\"  and  नागरी   nāgarī , \"[script] of the city.\"   The Chinese equivalent for  Vedanagari  is  学城体   Xuéchéngtǐ , \"Academic City Script,\"  while Devanagari is known as  天城体   Tiānchéngtǐ , \"Heavenly City Script\"  in Chinese.

Notable Features [ ]   Mondstadt features some unique mechanics and environmental hazards:    Collecting three  Anemograna  generates a temporary  Wind Current .     Anemoculi  can be offered at  Statues of the Seven  in Mondstadt for rewards.   Dragonspine  is a snow-covered mountain in southern Mondstadt.  Frostbearing Tree's Gratitude  is an  Offering System  where you exchange    Crimson Agate  ×10  for rewards at the  Frostbearing Tree .   Ice Blocks  (unofficial name)  can be melted with  Pyro , which has a chance of releasing a    Large Cryo Slime ,    Cryo Whopperflower ,    Cryo Crystalfly  ×2 , or    Snow Weasel .   Subzero Climate  causes the player to gradually accumulate  Sheer Cold  and prevents  Grass  from burning. When the Sheer Cold meter fills, the active character starts  losing HP .  Sheer Cold accumulates faster in  certain extremely cold locations  or when affected by  Cryo  or  Hydro .  Swimming  drastically increases Sheer Cold accumulation.   Sheer Cold accumulation can be mitigated by standing near to a source of warmth, being affected by  Pyro , or consuming  Goulash  when not in a snowstorm. Sheer Cold quickly dissipates upon leaving the area affected by Subzero Climate.   Collecting  Scarlet Quartz  reduces Sheer Cold by 5% of the maximum and imbues the player for 25 seconds or until the player performs an attack. While they are imbued, they do not accumulate Sheer Cold. A Scarlet Quartz imbued attack deals  Pyro DMG  and is the only way to destroy  Ancient Rime .   Wyrmrest Valley  contains the The Dragon's Core, an object that can turn    Strange Tooth  into    Vitalized Dragontooth .

It reads \" Mea libertas meus canor \" which translates to \"My freedom is my song.\"   Mondstadt considers the Dandelion, Flight and Wine to be its trademarks, being the very few things that it learned from the Wind Archon.   Roses in Mondstadt, instead of love, represent the saying \"As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed.\" It encourages people to keep one another's secrets.   Citizens and people in  Liyue  often mock Mondstadt for being a city without rule with their god abandoned, showcasing the contrast between how others view freedom versus constitution. They are also unaware of the reasons as to why the  Anemo Archon  decided not to rule over Mondstadt, which may hint that every other region shares the same outlook.   Mondstadt is the only region whose capital lacks background NPCs.   Etymology [ ]   Mondstadt is German for \"Moon City.\"  The official English translation of the  manga  sometimes abbreviates the name as \"Mond\", which is how it is translated in Chinese, as well as Japanese and Korean.   Cultural References [ ]   Mondstadt is primarily inspired by German culture, but also draws from other Germanic cultures.  Culture-wise and landscape-wise Mondstadt closely resembles Germany's  Rhineland-Palatinate  state. Wine culture has dominated this region for 2000 years. Annual  Weinlesefests  are held there just as they are in Mondstadt. Historic villages and towns are built like Mondstadt in a  half-timbered  architecture style with gothic churches and cathedrals. The Rhineland's landscape is lush and green, rolling hills take turns with high and steep cliffs. The steepest vineyards in the world are to be found there. Like Mondstadt, the Rhineland's landscape is dotted with the ruins of an ancient civilization, that of the Romans.   Many of Mondstadt's characters have German names or titles: Klee means \"clover\" in German. Fischl, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung means \"Princess of Condemnation.\" Albedo, Kreideprinz means \"Prince of Chalk.\" Diona of Kätzlein bloodline means of \"Kitten\" bloodline. Mika Schmidt's family name is the German version of \"Smith.\"   Mondstadt's annual spring festival is called Windblume, which is German for \"Wind Flower.\"   Mondstadt's annual autumn festival is called Weinlesefest, which is German for \"Wine Harvesting Festival.\"   The font of Mondstadt's written language is a broken up and mirrored version of  Fraktur , a font most typical in German-speaking countries from the Middle Ages until the early 21st century. You can still see it on many signs or old houses in Germany. However, the language itself is English, likely for easier international understanding.   The most important statue of Barbatos stands at Windrise under a massive oak tree. The oak is the national tree of Germany, thus oak leaves are a prominent symbol on most German military orders and currency.  The de facto ruling body of Mondstadt are the Knights of Favonius which mirrors the  State of the Teutonic Order , in which the Grand Master of the Order is the head of state.   Mondstadt is also called the Free City; this title was given to  sovereignly ruled city-states  of the  Holy Roman Empire , the medieval predecessor of what today is Germany. Today the official name of German cities, especially those of the  Hanseatic League  like Hamburg or Bremen, still carry the Free City prefix.   While the national bird of Mondstadt  yīng  ( Chinese :  鹰 ) is translated as a falcon in the English version, in reality it more commonly means an eagle/hawk in Mandarin (see  Vennessa#Trivia  for details). The eagle is one of the most significant symbols of Germany, and the Federal Republic of Germany adopts the  Bundesadler  (\"Federal Eagle\" in German) as its coat of arms. It is a successor of the Reichsadler (\"Imperial Eagle\") of the Holy Roman Empire, which in turn originates from the  Aquila  of ancient Rome, the symbol of the Roman legions.   \" Die Luft der Freiheit weht ,\" meaning \"The wind of freedom blows,\" is a notable German motto originated from a Latin phrase written by the German poet laureate and humanist  Ulrich von Hutten  (1488–1523). See  Venti's Etymology section  for details.   Since the  Romantic era  Germans call their country \"Das Land der Dichter und Denker\" (\"The Land of Poets and Thinkers\"). Mondstadt is famous for being a nation of poetry too. Fittingly, the original Chinese version as well as the Japanese version of the game call Mondstadt's biggest hotel the \"Goethe Grand Hotel.\"  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  was Germany's most prominent poet of the Romantic era. In the English version of the game, probably due to a translation mistake, the aforementioned hotel is called the  Goth Grand Hotel .  Goethe was also a major contributor to the philosophy of freedom and the most famous quotes from his magnum opus  Faust  include \"The last result of wisdom stamps it true: he only earns his freedom and existence who daily conquers them anew\" ( German :  \"Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluß: der verdient sich Freiheit wie das Leben, der täglich sie erobern muß\" ) (translated by  Bayard Taylor ), of which the first clause is cited as the English name of  Mona's special food .   The Black-Back Hound dog race, that the game archive says originates in Mondstadt, is of the distinctive tan and black fur color and pattern of the  German Shepherd .   The Anemo icon goes around the windmill and is reminiscent of a large predatory bird.   Besides, the English names for areas in Mondstadt are composed of Anglo-Saxon (native English) words.  Name of several characters in Mondstadt, for example,  Amber ,  Bennett ,  Razor ,  Sucrose  and  Thoma  originate from English.   The icon for Mondstadt consists of a six-spoked  post mill , something commonly found throughout Medieval Europe, especially in the Netherlands.

It reads \" Perpetua perennis impervia \" which translates to \"Perpetual, perennial, impervious.\"   A competition called \"This Novel Is Amazing!\" is held periodically in Inazuma, by the  Yae Publishing House , a giant of the Inazuma publishing industry. [3]   According to  Xu , a novel called \" A Legend of Sword \" is \"all the rage in Inazuma right now\" It was written by an author in  Liyue , although the exact person is unknown to the residents of Inazuma. The author is revealed to be  Xingqiu .   According to  Barbara , there are blue trees that exist by the sea shore near Inazuma City. [4]   Kaedehara Kazuha  is the first playable character from Inazuma in the global release.  Kamisato Ayaka  was available in a closed beta test version of the game, but wasn't released as part of the global release of the game until Version 2.0.   The storm barrier that was created as part of the  Sakoku Decree  is encountered as the climate  A Nation Closed by Thunder  when attempting to enter or leave Inazuma via ice bridging or  Waverider . When players are too far in the storm barrier, they are teleported to  Liyue Harbor  if they tried to enter Inazuma or  Ritou  if they tried to exit Inazuma. This means that the only way to get to Inazuma for the first time is through the quest  Setting Sail  ( Archon Quest   Chapter II , Act I:  The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia ), during which the  Teleport Waypoint  at the docks of Ritou will be automatically unlocked, and the only way to enter and leave Inazuma afterwards is through activated Teleport Waypoints (including  Portable Waypoints ),  Statues of The Seven , and  Domains .   All of Inazuma's 5 star characters are  Event-Exclusive Characters .   After completing the  Raiden Shogun 's  Story Quest ,  Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter : Act II -  Transient Dreams , it is possible to enter Inazuma without being teleported back due to the abolishment of the Sakoku Decree.   Etymology [ ]   The name of the region \"Inazuma\" ( Japanese :  稲妻   Inadzuma ) means \"lightning\" in Japanese.  The modern Japanese word  inazuma  ( Japanese :  稲妻   inadzuma ) originates from an Old Japanese word spelled with the same kanji  ( Old Japanese :  稲妻   inaNduma ), literally meaning \"rice's spouse\" (nowadays  tsuma  (>  zuma ) means \"wife,\" but it was gender-neutral in ancient times). In ancient Japan, there was a lot of thunder during the rice fruition period, so there was a belief that lightning would produce rice, and thus Japanese found \"rice's spouse\" as a nickname of thunder.   The Japanese word has two coexisting spellings in Modern Japanese:  いなづま   inadzuma  (using  つ   tsu  with  dakuten ) and  いなずま   inazuma  (using  す   su  with  dakuten ). Since  づ   dzu  and  ず   zu  are pronounced identically in Modern Japanese, [Note 1]  many speakers today spell it with  ず   zu  despite the proper spelling being with  づ   dzu . [Note 2]  The game officially uses the  ず   zu  spelling ( いなずま ), meaning it should be romanized as \"Inazuma\" and not \"Inadzuma.\"   Cultural References [ ]   Inazuma is inspired by Japan.   Much like real-life Japan, Inazuma is currently only reachable by the sea around the islands.   The Sakoku Decree of Inazuma and collection of Visions parallels the real-life  sakoku  policy under the Japanese Tokugawa shogunate.   The Inazuma Shogunate, the ruling body of the country, is a direct reference to the same government used under the Japanese shogunate.   The Inazuman Emblem consists of traditional Japanese elements.  At the center of the emblem lies a  torii , the sacred gate of a Shinto shrine.   Inside the  torii  gate, there is an  Electro  symbol, based on a  mitsudomoe .  Raijin , God of Thunder, often carries drums with  mitsudomoe  symbols.   The rounded rectangles seen at the both sides of the torii are called  suyari-gasumi  and represent clouds, fog, or haze in traditional Japanese paintings and woodblock prints.   Under the  torii  gate, three comma-shaped jewels are illustrated. Among these  magatama  beads, the most important one is  Yasakani no Magatama , one of the three  Imperial Regalia of Japan  and the symbol of benevolence.   A  sakura  (cherry) blossom crowns the torii gate. In Japanese culture, it usually represents the aesthetics of  mono no aware  ( Japanese :  もののあはれ  \"the pathos of things\" ), or the awareness of impermanence, ephemeral beauty, and the gentle sadness of things. But considering the in-game Inazuman ideal \"eternity\", [5]  in this case the  sakura  blossom may symbolize the \"endless cycle of death and rebirth\". [6]   The design and theme of the  Watatsumi Island  is the amalgamation of the  Ryukyuan religion  (indigenous belief system of southwestern islands in Japan) endorsed by the  Ryukyu Kingdom  (1429–1879; its capital was in  Okinawa ) and the sea-god  Watatsumi  mythology in mainland Japan, as the divine sea realm  Nirai Kanai  in Ryukyu and the sea dragon palace  Ryuuguu-jou  in the mainland are often identified with each other.   Names used in the  Tsurumi Island  are based on the  Ainu language , spoken by the  Ainu people , an indigenous people in now the northern part of Japan (such as  Hokkaido  Island) and now the southeasternmost part of Russia (such as  Sakhalin  Island).

    "Raiden_Gokaden": "Raiden Gokaden     Type   Lore       Region   Inazuma       The  Raiden Gokaden  ( Japanese :  雷電五箇伝  \"Five Traditions of Raiden\" ) were five bladesmithing schools in  Inazuma 's weaponsmithing scene, each specializing in their own unique forging art.  According to legend, the Raiden Gokaden developed from the blade-forging techniques taught by the  Raiden Shogun , and the variations are \"based on astrology, application, materials used, the furnace conditions, individual personalities, and elemental changes.\" [1]  Each art also developed their own techniques and secrets. [2]  The families in the Raiden Gokaden eventually also became key members of the  Yashiro Commission  due to the cultural importance swordsmithing held in Inazuma. [3]   Presently, only the  Amenoma Art  still thrives while the  Isshin Art  has been mostly lost following the Case of the Eccentric, which saw  Kaedehara Yoshinori  put an end to the practice to protect his family from  Scaramouche . The other three schools and their forging arts were completely destroyed as a result of Scaramouche's machinations.

Its current master is  Amenoma Tougo , with  Hajime  as his disciple.    Isshin Art [ ]   Main article:  Isshin Art   The  Isshin Art  ( Japanese :  一心伝 ) only barely survives in the present. In the past, it was host to three master swordsmiths, also known as the  Isshin Sansaku :  Kaedehara Kagemitsu ,  Niwa Nagamitsu , and  Akame Mitsunaga . [4] [Note 1]  The  Kaedehara Clan ,  Niwa Clan , and  Akame School  were the three main families who followed the Isshin Art's practice up until the Case of the Eccentric.    Futsu Art [ ]   Main article:  Futsu School   The  Futsu Art  ( Japanese :  経津伝 ) is a lost school. Its third-generation master,  Futsu Minori , forged the Hasui Geppaku Futsu, while her foster son  Futsu Masayoshi  forged the  Haran Geppaku Futsu . While Masayoshi was more skilled in swordsmithing than his sworn brother  Futsu Hiroyoshi , Minori's son, Hiroyoshi eventually inherited the Futsu school while Masayoshi went on to mentor the swordsmiths who would later become the  Isshin Sansaku .    Hyakume Art [ ]   The  Hyakume Art  ( Japanese :  百目伝 ) is a lost school. Little is known about them, although they are slightly more involved in the revised version of history after the removal of \"Scaramouche\" from  Irminsul . In the revised version of the Case of the Eccentric, the unnamed head of the Hyakume Art carried out an indiscriminate slaughter of the Raiden Gokaden, not sparing even the other members of his own school.    Senju Art [ ]   The  Senju Art  ( Japanese :  千手伝 ) is a lost school. No further information is known about them at the time.    History [ ]   According to legend, the Raiden Gokaden were developed when a ronin taught his five disciples the art of forging. Each art then developed their own techniques and secrets. [2]  The families in the Raiden Gokaden eventually also became key members of the  Yashiro Commission  due to the cultural importance swordsmithing held in Inazuma. [3]     Tatarasuna Mystery [ ]   Main article:  Tatarasuna Mystery   During the Tatarasuna Mystery, the Armory Officer in charge of the Mikage Furnace was  Niwa Hisahide , who was the head of the  Niwa Clan  at the time. He befriended the kabukimono  Katsuragi  found in  Shakkei Pavilion  and treated him as his friend, [5]  with the two having been shown to have forged blades with each other. The then-head of the Akame Clan introduced a mechanic from Fontaine,  Escher , to Niwa, as Escher had formed a technique that would revolutionize the forging process at the Mikage Furnace. [6]   When the furnace started making workers deathly ill due to the black gas it was emitting, Niwa decided to go into the furnace and use Escher's purification device at the cost of his own life. After confirming his decision with Escher, Niwa confronted the mechanic over his suspicions that the furnace was sabotaged by Escher's own hand. Escher played coy until Niwa's back was turned and took the opportunity to fatally stab Niwa. He revealed himself as the  Fatui Harbinger   Il Dottore , that his actions had all been for an experiment, and lastly, that the purification device was designed for the kabukimono. Shortly after Niwa died, Dottore placed his still-warm heart into the purification device and gave it to the kabukimono so that he would purify the furnace in Niwa's place. After the purification was completed, the kabukimono asked Dottore, who was disguised as Escher, how he survived the ordeal in the furnace. Dottore pointed to the device, which he had previously claimed was entrusted by Niwa and the kabukimono opened it only to find a withered heart. Dottore wove a story that Niwa killed an innocent subordinate, placed it in the device, and fled Tatarasuna with his family. Feeling betrayed by Niwa's alleged cowardice, yet saved by it all the same, the kabukimono departed from Tatarasuna with a heavy heart. [7]   Dottore repeated his fabricated story to the other workers at Tatarasuna, leading people to believe his lies. When the authorities came to investigate the matter,  Mikoshi Nagamasa  — the Inspector at Tatarasuna and thus the next authority figure after Niwa — was going to have to take responsibility for the catastrophe with his own life. To prevent this from happening to his benefactor, Katsuragi took the blame onto himself and was executed by Nagamasa's hand. [8]   After another incident which alienated him from humanity, the kabukimono left Inazuma entirely and wandered aimlessly. Over a hundred years later,  Pierro  sought him out and convinced him to join the  Fatui . He joined Dottore's \"grand research project,\" completely unaware that he had been Escher in disguise or that he was responsible for the tragedy at Tatarasuna. [9]     Case of the Eccentric [ ]   In order to take revenge an unspecified \"bladesmith,\" the kabukimono — having adopted the name \" Kunikuzushi \" — masterminded the fall of the Raiden Gokaden. By the time of  Kaedehara Yoshinori 's generation, [Note 2]  the Futsu, Hyakume, and Senju schools had befallen strange mishaps and disappeared. [10]   When the Isshin Art was tasked with recreating a  goshintou  with a diagram from the Raiden Shogun, their swordsmiths kept producing defective blades. Afraid of the punishment they would receive for failing to produce a successful blade by the due date, the swordsmiths fled, taking refuge with the Fatui and going on a self-imposed exile to  Snezhnaya . [11]  Suspecting that the diagram had been tampered with to sabotage them, Yoshinori and the  Kamisato Clan  head at the time attempted to pursue them. They were intercepted and singlehandedly defeated by Kunikuzushi, who was the one responsible for tampering with the diagram. After realizing Yoshinori was from the Niwa family and raised by the Kaedehara family after his father disappeared, Kunikuzushi left Yoshinori and the Kamisato head alive with a vague message: \"Tell her this. My name is Kunikuzushi.\" [12]  He then left, having lost interest in his project. [10]  This incident came to be known as the Case of the Eccentric. [11]   Afraid of retaliation should they reveal the truth, Yoshinori and the Kamisato head agreed to cover up the events that had transpired. On account of his old age and the wounds he had sustained, the Kamisato head died shortly afterwards, leaving a vacancy in the clan and the commission. Furthermore, the failure to produce a successful blade or apprehend the fleeing swordsmiths was seen as a failing of the Yashiro Commission, which lost the Kamisato Clan its prestige and led to harassment by the Fatui. [1] [13]  The matter was taken before the Raiden Shogun, but before she could pronounce her judgement on the issue,  Yae Miko  intervened on the Kamisato Clan's behalf. The Shogun spared the clan from punishment, and the Kamisatos thereafter swore to serve the Shogun eternally out of gratitude. [14]     Legacy [ ]   The Amenoma Art is the only school among the Raiden Gokaden to continue its practice to this day, led by  Amenoma Tougo . Kunikuzushi's attack on Yoshinori and the Kamisato head had lasting impacts on the Kaedehara and Kamisato Clans: Yoshinori ended the practice of the Isshin Art and his son,  Kaedehara Kazuha 's grandfather, never discovered the truth and was unable to revive the family business. By the time Kazuha came of age, the Kaedehara Clan lost its fortunes and properties. [3] [15]  The Kamisato Clan failed to rebound from the repercussions of the event until  Kamisato Ayato  became the clan head.  Yoshinori wrote down the truth of what had occurred, but concealed it using ink that would only appear after coming into contact with water. The truth remained undiscovered up until Ayato, while investigating a Fatui spy who had searched through the confiscated Kaedehara Clan's possessions, came across the document and figured out the secret it held. Ayato then masterminded a plan to relay the truth he had uncovered to Kazuha over the course of the  Irodori Festival , using a fabricated legend of  The Five Kasen  as a metaphor. [16]     Revision [ ]   After Scaramouche learned the truth from the memories stored in  Irminsul , feeling guilt that he had been deceived to, he decided to remove all traces of himself in Irminsul to restore the Raiden Gokaden and the lives that had been ruined. However, the changes made were very minor, as his removal simply prevented Dottore from using him and preventing his recruitment into the Fatui. Dottore still infiltrated the furnace and did not kill Niwa, although he and an unnamed blacksmith went inside and fixed the furnace at the cost of their own lives.  The unnamed blacksmith had a son who was left orphaned as a result of his father's death and was left embittered with the Shogun for her refusal to help. He passed on his hatred to his future generations, who all lived in misery. Roughly 300 years after the Tatarigami incident, the then-head of the clan snapped and decided to destroy the Raiden Gokaden, killing all blacksmiths in his path in an attempt to end the Raiden Gokaden. The then-head was successful in eliminating the Futsu, Hyakume, and Senju Arts, but was unsuccessful in eliminating the Amenoma and Isshin Arts, as he was stopped by the Kaedehara and Kamisato Clans, who killed him and put an end to the havoc.    Trivia [ ]   The sword art schools are referred to as  伝  \"Tradition/School,\"  while the practices are referred to as  流  \"Art.\"   According to  Amenoma Tougo 's regular dialogue, the Raiden Gokaden formed after a ronin taught his five disciples the art of forging. However, this explanation is at odds with the Voice-Over  More About Kamisato Ayaka: III , which was released in the same  Version  but named the Raiden Shogun as the origin of the sword arts.  The original Chinese version of Tougo's dialogue still attributes the Gokaden to \"a certain ronin\" ( Chinese :  某位浪人 ), but the ronin's pronouns are not specified.   After Scaramouche removes himself from Irminsul and the  Traveler  goes to verify the resulting changes in history, Tougo's explanation on the Raiden Gokaden attributes their origins to the Raiden Shogun. [17]   Etymology [ ]   The term  gokaden  ( Japanese :  五箇伝  \"The Five Traditions\" ) is ascribed to five major swordsmithing schools in Japan, each named after the province where the school originated from. The Japanese  gokaden  are: the Yamashiro tradition ( 山城伝 ), the Yamato tradition ( 大和伝 ), the Bizen tradition ( 備前伝 ), the Sōshū tradition ( 相州伝 ), and the Mino tradition ( 美濃伝 ).  The Isshin Art appears to be somewhat analogous to the Bizen tradition: The Isshin Art's three masters ( sansaku ), Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Sanenaga (Mitsunaga in the English localization) are directly named after the  sansaku  of the Bizen Osafune School.   Notes [ ]     ↑   In the English localization of Haran Geppaku Futsu, the Isshin Sansaku are described as three works created by Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Mitsunaga. While the phrase  sansaku  ( Japanese :  三作 ) literally translates to \"three works,\"  sansaku  is also used as a collective title for the real-life swordsmiths Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Sanenaga, three master swordsmiths of the Bizen Osafune School.     ↑   Yoshinori is Kaedehara Kazuha's great-grandfather and was a young man by the time these events occurred. Assuming Kazuha is in his late teens to early twenties, and every generation spans roughly 20 to 40 years, the events that directly led to the Kaedehara Clan's collapse would have taken place around 60–120 years ago.

They are encountered in the  World Quest  Series  Aranyaka .  They were led by  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata  — whom they called \"Queen Aranyani\" — up until her disappearance. [3]   After  Lesser Lord Kusanali  erased the memory of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from the  Irminsul  during the  Archon Quest   Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies  in  Chapter III : Act V -  Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises , like any Teyvatian creatures, the Aranara also forgot her as Queen Aranyani. With this revised history, they believe that they are the children of the current Dendro Archon, whom they refer to as The Lord of Verdure.

Many Aranara fought fiercely against the invaders of the  Abyss , but they were forced to abandon their old home and made a new home at  Vanarana .  At some point prior to the events of the game, the  Traveler's Sibling  met with the Aranara, who referred to them as the \"Nara Varuna.\" They helped them with the  Varuna Contraption  prior to their departure, after which they told them to expect another golden-haired human who would give them even better memories.  The Aranara do not normally trust most humans, especially adults, though they befriend children and are often referred to as a myth as no adult had ever seen them with their own eyes before. The Aranara relate this to a sense of mistrust in adults and thus deem them as \"grown up\", who try to say goodbye to their younger selves but rarely succeed. They see children as those who had not \"grown up\", though they have made a few exceptions to this should they deem them trustworthy, such as  Rana  and  Yoimiya .    Powers and Abilities [ ]   All Aranara are capable of hiding themselves from the human eye, although they are only seen by children, most likely due to the fact that they dream, whereas adults do not. Specific adults, primarily those who are trusted by the Aranara or have a fiercely pure and warm heart, can also see Aranara, even if they haven't met before; two examples of these are  Rana [4]  and  Yoimiya , though the latter did not have any encounters with Aranara. [5]   Being attuned with nature, Aranara are also capable of communicating with plants and fungi (e.g. mushrooms like  Rukkhashava Mushrooms , not the monsters called  fungi ).  Aranara love memories, although some of them are prone to forgetting quite easily, so some Aranara give flowers to their friends so they can remember them if they meet again. They can draw on the memories to gain power to use from the plants of the forest, known as  Ararakalari . Every Aranara has their own Ararakalari, which can be used to fight enemies, restrain or suppress their strength, teleport across great distances in an instant and even block several areas off.  Every Aranara has their own tune, and every tune is different, so the Aranara know who's home. [6]  Each tune can be played by the Traveler with the  Vintage Lyre .

Once interacted with, they will provide a reward, then leave for  Mahavanaranapna  (the dream version of Vanarana), where they can be found. There are a total of 64 such Aranara spread throughout various areas of  Dharma Forest ,  Sumeru .    Confused Aranara [ ]   Main article:  Confused Aranara   Confused Aranara (14 total) appear in odd locations in a hunched position. They can be awakened by applying  Dendro  onto them. Afterward, if they are interacted with, they will reward 5,000 Mora and a few Sumeru  Materials .    Material-Collecting Aranara [ ]   Main article:  Material-Collecting Aranara   Material-Collecting Aranara (14 total) will ask for materials, which always include  Viparyas  and possibly other materials in addition to it. After interacting with them and submitting their requested items, they will reward either 10,000 Mora or two 2★  Sumeru Teachings .

If the hiding Aranara is found while the Seed Mirror is still affected by Electro, it will relocate nearby and can be interacted with. After being spoken to, they will not give any reward directly, but instead leave behind two one-time investigation points.    Music-Loving Aranara [ ]   Main article:  Music-Loving Aranara   Music-Loving Aranara (14 total) can be found singing, which Paimon will notify about if detected nearby. Upon interacting with them by playing the  Rhythm of the Great Dream  with the Vintage Lyre, they will reward two 2★  Sumeru Teachings .    Reckless Aranara [ ]   Main article:  Reckless Aranara   Reckless Aranara (14 total) are found near a group of enemies. They can only be interacted with after defeating the enemies. When interacted with, they will reward 5,000 Mora and some Sumeru Materials.    Language [ ]           Example of the Aranara Language written on a Silapna Leaf       Main article:  Aranara Language   The  Aranara Language   (unofficial name)  is the language spoken by the Aranara of  Sumeru . The  Aranara  often include words from this language while speaking. It also appears that there may be a script for this language written in multiple  Aranara  inscriptions, such as the text found on the  Silapna 's leaf, or the text written on multiple walls.  The language's lexicon appears to be based on Sanskrit. For example, the Aranara term for human or person, \"Nara,\" likely comes from  नर   nara , \"human, person.\"  Similarly, the Aranara word for  Spinocrocodile , \"Apshvaana,\" is Sanskrit for \"water dog\" and derives from  अप्   ap , \"water\"  and  श्वान   śvāna , \"dog.\"     Trivia [ ]   The Aranara are mentioned in the descriptions of the following 33  Furnishings :   \"Gate of Phantasm\"   \"The Poetry of Song and Dreams\"   Prototype Aranara   Singing Majalis   Wooden Torso: Cozy Rest   Wooden Torso: Swagger   Wooden Torso: Tiger's Roar   Wooden Torso: Wise Elder   Pink Torso: Swagger   Pink Torso: Cozy Rest   Pink Torso: Tiger's Roar   Pink Torso: Wise Elder   Blue Torso: Swagger   Blue Torso: Cozy Rest   Blue Torso: Tiger's Roar   Blue Torso: Wise Elder   Wooden Head: Ho Ho   Wooden Head: Hehe   Wooden Head: Hmph   Pink Head: Ho Ho   Pink Head: Hehe   Blue Head: Ho Ho   Blue Head: Hmph   Wood-Carved Hat: Forest Dwellers   Pink Head: Hmph   Blue Head: Hehe   Wood-Carved Hat: Slacker   Wood-Carved Hat: Diviner   Wood-Carved Cape: Forest Guardian   Wood-Carved Cape: Polymath   Wood-Carved Hat: Fareweller   Wood-Carved Cape: Singer   Taste of Warmth   Etymology [ ]   Aranara is possibly derived from the Sanskrit words  áraṇya  ( Sanskrit :  अरण्य ) meaning \"forest\" or \"wilderness,\" and  nára  ( Sanskrit :  नर ) meaning \"man\" or \"person.\"  It may also be related to  Aranyaka , meaning \"produced, born, relating to a forest\" or \"belonging to the wilderness.\" The Aranyakas are a part of the Indian  Vedas  bearing the meaning of ritual sacrifice. [7]   Appearance [ ]   The Aranaras' faces resemble the letter  ت  in Arabic-based script, such as Arabic and Persian. [8]   The Aranara are a plant-like creature with varying shapes and colors. They can be seen wearing a hat-like mushroom or two leaves with an ornamental pattern. They have a leaf propeller on top of their head which they can use to fly. They can also wear accessories like bowtie, weapon, bag, or scarf.

There is but one recorded exception: years ago, the bake-danuki who guarded Chinju Forest started a battle due to some conflict between their leader Ioroi and a  kitsune . In the end, most of the bake-danuki were sealed within stone statues.

Type   Species Lore Factions Liyue Culture       An  illuminated beast  ( Chinese :  仙兽   xiānshòu ) is a creature with supernatural abilities, including heightened combat prowess, extreme longevity, and the ability to speak human language. Most known illuminated beasts are also  adepti  and have signed a contract with  Morax  to protect  Liyue .

Madame Ping mentions that the adeptal arts taught to them by Morax were part of their \"illumination,\" [1]  which suggests that not all illuminated beasts are born illuminated. Further supporting this idea is the fact that  Cloud Retainer  and  Mountain Shaper  are both cranes, but various species of cranes can be hunted like regular animals and display no sign of illumination.  Full-blooded illuminated beasts can shapeshift into human forms [2] [3]  and create offspring with mortal humans. [4]  Such half-blooded children will be humanoid with a few non-human traits indicating their illuminated beast heritage; it is unclear how their illuminated beast heritage will affect their growth, aging, or mystical abilities, if at all. Of the two currently known cases,  Ganyu  is old enough to witness the fall of the  Guili Assembly  and the rise of  Liyue Harbor  3,700 years ago, yet she has the stature of a teenager. On the other hand,  Yanfei  has the stature of a teenager, but she is young enough that her mortal mother is still alive and traveling with her father, a full-blooded adeptus.    Known Illuminated Beast Types [ ]   Mammalian [ ]   The following types of illuminated beasts are depicted in-game to have mostly mammalian features.    Deer-Like [ ]   Two known illuminated beasts take the form of deer:  Moon Carver  and  Skybracer .    Suanni [ ]   The Suanni are a type of illuminated beast primarily found around  Chenyu Vale , and are believed by the locals to be the original rulers of the land who secluded themselves in the mountains after peace came to Liyue. Three Suanni are currently known: the  Solitary Suanni ,  Lingyuan , and  Man Chai ,  Gaming 's partner. [5]     Qilin [ ]   The  qilin  are gentle creatures who refuse to harm any animal, living a vegetarian lifestyle, with fur as soft as clouds. However, when they do not live in times of peace, they will fight. [4] [6]  Ganyu is half-qilin.    Xiezhi [ ]   No other instances of this beast has been observed in Teyvat lore with the exception for Yanfei, who is half-xiezhi, [Note 1]  and her father who is implied to be a full-blooded one. Xiezhi have not been described in-game, but have appeared as an ornament on Yanfei's stamper. The creature is depicted to be goat or deer-like in appearance with a pair of antlers behind the ears, and a fluffy coat.    Avian [ ]   The following types of illuminated beasts are depicted in-game to have mostly avian features.    Crane-Like [ ]   A number of illuminated beasts are known to take the form of cranes:  Cloud Retainer ,  Mountain Shaper , and the yaksha  Pervases .   Yuandai  is described as \"a crane who gained sentience\". She was able to transform into a human form using Cloud Retainer's potion, and beyond this she demonstrated no supernatural abilities. Cloud Retainer stated that, with training, Yuandai has the potential to become an adepti. It is unknown if she could be classified as an illuminated beast.    Unknown Taxon [ ]   Xiao 's avian beast form has been teased in his character design, his  constellation , and his yaksha alias Alatus. It is implied that he takes on the form of  Garuda , a Hindu demigod, or  Peng  (can be seen in the Chinese translation of Alatus:  金鹏   Jīnpéng ), a creature present in both Chinese and Buddhist myths.  In some lines of Genshin Impact merchandise, stylized depictions of Xiao's avian form has been shown. The bird form appears to be finch-like, though this is inconclusive due to stylization. Its plumage features multiple shades of teal, reddish eyes and Xiao's purple diamond symbol on its forehead.    Goose-Like [ ]   Based on  Sea Gazer 's Mingxiao Lantern during  The Exquisite Night Chimes , he had a goose-like appearance.    Known Members [ ]   Pure-Blooded Illuminated Beasts [ ]   Cloud Retainer   Mountain Shaper   Moon Carver   Skybracer   Yanfei 's Father   Fujin   Herblord   Lingyuan   Solitary Suanni   Man Chai   Yakshas [ ]   Yakshas  are illuminated beasts. [7]  They prefer to take humanoid forms, but their true forms are believed to be animals.    Alatus  — Beast form implied to resemble  Garuda  or  Peng .   Bosacius   Indarias   — Beast form implied to be a Fire Rat.   Bonanus   Menogias  — Beast form stated to be ape-like. [8]   Pervases  — Beast form is a crane.   Mixed Ancestry [ ]   Ganyu  (half-qilin)   Yanfei  (half-xiezhi) [9]   Trivia [ ]   In Chinese mythology,  qilin  are one-horned beasts with a dragon-like appearance, although details about their appearance vary greatly with different dynasties and regions.  Genshin  uses the Buddhist-influenced depictions of qilin as peaceful and benevolent creatures who will not eat flesh or harm living beings, and only appear in areas ruled by wise and benevolent rulers. While peaceful by nature, qilin will defend the innocent from the wicked.  Qilin are seen as symbols of immortality, good fortune, and sometimes, fertility. Tales of qilin leaving a baby at a family's doorstep was integrated into  Records of Jueyun: Qilin .   While mythological qilin only have one horn,  Genshin  depicts qilin with two horns.   Xiezhi  are also Chinese mythological beasts, often depicted as ox- or goat-like creatures with a single long horn. They are seen as symbols of justice and law who can instinctively distinguish right from wrong. A xiezhi will point out the faulty party by either ramming them with its horn or biting them.   Qiqi uses the term \"adeptibeast\" to describe the (ultimately fictional) Cocogoat. This term is rendered in the Chinese version as  半仙之兽  \"a half-xian beast.\"   In Shenhe's  Character Details , the English localization uses the phrase \"odd passing illuminated beast.\" The original Chinese text, however, uses  灵兽  \"spirit (or divine) beast\" , which is only used twice in the game: here, and in the Archive description for  Sumeru 's  Rishboland Tiger , where the term is localized as \"divine beast\" and refers to  Viaghara .   Etymology [ ]   Like the adepti, the first character in the Chinese name for illuminated beasts is  仙   Xiān , a term that refers to  Taoist Immortals .  In Chinese art,  xian  are often depicted with symbols of longevity, including dragons, cranes, white deer, and foxes. The first three have been mentioned as illuminated beasts and/or adepti:  Morax 's Exuvia takes the form of a dragon, Cloud Retainer and Mountain Shaper are cranes, and Moon Carver and Skybracer are deer (albeit not pure white).

    "Jinni": "Jinni     Type   Species Lore       Region   Sumeru       The  Jinn  (singular:  Jinni ) are a mystical race of elemental spirits that were created by  Nabu Malikata .  After the goddess's death, they turned to serve  King Deshret . Besides bottles, Jinn are also stated to indwell items such as weapons. [1]     Contents     1   Overview   2   History   3   Known Jinni   4   Trivia     4.1   Etymology       5   Other Languages   6   Change History   7   References       Overview [ ]   I'm a creation of the sky, yet also a creature of this world. I'm an exile of the ages, a faithful servant to my great lord. I'm an elemental spirit who will not bow to flesh and blood, an eternal prisoner content with the illusion of comfort... —The Jinni in  The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle   Jinn are elemental spirits and have translucent bodies; while the female jinn described in legends are implied to have human-like features, the jinni in  Dori 's lamp has a distinctly non-human appearance and instead appears as a spherical creature with a grinning face.  Jinn are believed to be capable of possessing a human's body, which one Jinni uses as a threat against the human boy she dubs \"Raven.\" [2]  Normally, however, they reside in items such as magic lamps or weapons.    History [ ]   The Jinn were born after Nabu Malikata was cast aside by the heavens, said to be birthed from \"intoxicating dreams and the bitter memories of loss.\" Nabu Malikata wandered the barren wastes for seventy-two nights, her heels worn through by the gravel. The blood that gushed from those wounds turned into springs and streams, which subsequently flowed into gardens. The Jinn were born from the water lilies that grew in those gardens. The Jinn begged her to stay with them, and she agreed. [3]   Eventually, Nabu Malikata met King Deshret, and together they built the city of  Ay-Khanoum , a name which means \"City of the Moon Maiden\" in the Jinn's ancient language. [4]  In stories that do not include the Goddess of Flowers, it is instead believed that King Deshret learned about the Jinn's story after capturing them and, afterwards, built Ay-Khanoum as a gift to the Jinn; in return, they built the entrance to the  Mausoleum of King Deshret . [2]   The Jinn allegedly became willing servants of King Deshret in his endeavor to rule over the world, entering the silver magic bottles he created for them and becoming marked by his seal. Afterwards, they engaged in acts of creation and exploration on his behalf. [2]  According to  Liloupar , King Deshret had deceived the Jinn to gain their servitude, telling them that the Goddess of Flowers had not perished but was instead locked in a deep slumber in  The Orchard of Pairidaeza , and that he could awaken her with the Jinn's aid.     Known Jinni [ ]   See also:  Category:Jinn   Currently, most Jinni have been left unnamed.    Liloupar  (fairy, ancestor of the Jinni and a Jinni herself) [2] [5]   Shirin  (half-human, daughter of Liloupar) [6]   Ferigees , older sister of Liloupar, in  Eternal Oasis  locking mechanism [7]   The Jinni in  The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle  and  The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin  (may be fictitious)   Makhaira 's mother [8]   The Jinni in  Xiphos' Moonlight   The Jinni in  Dori 's lamp   Trivia [ ]   Etymology [ ]   Jinn  ( Arabic :  جن ), commonly anglicized as \"genie\" in English writing, are invisible creatures in Arabic religious systems that are not inherently good or evil. However, if hurt, they will take revenge on the person who wronged them or possess their body.  The belief that jinni can be placed inside magical items was popularized by the story  One Thousand and One Nights , specifically in the tale of  The Fisherman and the Jinni .   The concept of King Deshret marking the Jinn with his seal is likely derived from the real-life legends surrounding the  Seal of Solomon , which involves a ring engraved with said seal which allows its wearer to control jinni, given by God to the Israelite king  Solomon .

    "Melusine": "Melusine           Blathine in the Court of Fontaine       Type   Species Lore       Region   Fontaine       Melusines  are an all-female species in  Fontaine . They are the \"daughters\" of  Elynas . [1]   They were first shown in the  Version 3.8 Special Program , as part of a story narrated by  Alice  showcasing a teaser for the nation of Fontaine.

During this battle, \"someone\" caused an explosion, killing many and causing the mechanical components of  clockwork meka  to pierce through Elynas's body. The Melusines were eventually born from these wounds, with the components becoming \"tokens\" associated with each Melusine. [1] [2]   Elynas's consciousness regarded the Melusines as his own daughters, teaching them how to establish a home —  Merusea Village  — and enabling them to grow and live happily within his own remains. As time passed on, the Melusines could no longer hear Elynas's voice, and by the start of the game's events, only  Mamere  could hear him. [1]  After Mamere met and befriended  the Traveler , she could no longer hear his voice.  According to Mamere, all Melusines are born possessing special mementos known as \"tokens.\" These are mechanical components inscribed with runes, and can seemingly be used to interact with and repair  Clockwork Meka  such as  Seymour , who recognizes Mamere's token as his lost \"artificed clockwork relay module.\" [2]   According to  Carole , the Melusines stayed in the  Merusea Village  for almost twenty years until they met  Neuvillette , who responded to their wish and brought them to the  Court of Fontaine . [3]  Fontanians were hesitant to accept Melusines into their society at the time, believing them to be creatures of calamity due to an increase in \"strange incidents,\" coupled with Neuvillette having just been appointed as the Iudex.  Carole  was one of the few Melusines to venture outside Merusea Village, but she sacrificed herself to prove her innocence after being lured and framed by hardliners who opposed Neuvillette's reforms. Following her sacrifice and the subsequent trial of  Vautrin , in which he feigned anger to prove Neuvillette's impartiality and fairness, people began to trust both the Iudex and the Melusines. Neuvillette helped pass a law declaring that all Melusines are to be addressed with she/her pronouns rather than it/its [4]  and harsh punishments were imposed for anyone who treated them as monsters. By the events of the game, essentially every Fontanian is willing to protect a Melusine from danger, as exemplified during Neuvillette's Story Quest.  Melusines perceive visions and food differently from humans, and this perception has often confused and/or grossed people out; Mamere's art was considered incomprehensible to most, [2]  while  Sigewinne 's cooking, meant to help restore stamina, has the prisoners of the  Fortress of Meropide  call it \"mystery meat\" and an ill omen despite her efforts into making it. [5]  Likewise,  Wriothesley  describes her milkshakes as \"desolation.\" [6]   The  Breacher Primus  do not attack Melusines, as both were born from Elynas' body.  Fontaine's citizens believe Neuvillette shows more affection for Melusines than humans, equating it to a father's love. Similarly, Neuvillette recognizes Melusines as both his dependents and successors, believing them to be a great example of a \"new sort of Hydro  Vishap  species.\" [7]   Some of the Melusines, particularly Sigewinne, enjoy reading astrology publications. [8]     Overview [ ]   A Melusine is described as diligent with her duties and having a great sense of justice. The Melusine shown in Alice's story, who appears to be  Blathine , sports a miniaturized version of the officer's uniform worn by  Gardes .  Melusines view the Chief Justice as \"[their] ideal of the perfect father.\" It is also noted that he took up his post before the Melusines first appeared. [9]   The denizens of Merusea Village value scrap mechanical parts as a form of currency similar to Mora, called \" components ,\" due to their aesthetic quality and abundance in the area. Melusines use these components in the exchange of goods such as those sold by  Xana , and give them to one another as tokens of gratitude for helping each other out. [10]   Many Melusines are part of the  Marechaussee Phantom  due to their powerful eyesight and increased perception relative to normal humans. Melusines are implied to have very long lives, as several Melusines such as  Sigewinne  and  Kiara  are known to be at least over 400 years old. [11]     Appearance [ ]   Melusines are bipedal creatures of a short stature, and are almost  faun -like in appearance. They have long, tufted tails; long ear- or horn-like head protrusions resembling the  rhinophores  of sea slugs; mitten-like hands; and stubby feet. Some have small wing-like appendages on their backs.  Sigewinne is a lone exception, as while she is still a Melusine, she has a \"special body\" which makes physiologically similar to a human. [12]  Her human-like appearance is due to a potion she had consumed from her teacher, who was willing to teach Melusines at a time when they were still viewed with suspicion. She had befriended a human, though when her friend became ill, her parents refused to let her give treatment due to being a Melusine, and she took the potion in order to appear as a human and save her friend. She decided to remain in her current form ever since. [13]   Each Melusine has their own combination of integument color, hairstyle and garb. The variance of accoutrements seen among Melusines presupposes the variety of jobs or roles they perform in Fontaine.

She is usually depicted as a woman whose bottom half is of a fish or a serpent, and less commonly with wings or two tails. In France, the country on which Fontaine is inspired, Melusine legends are majorly prevalent in its northern regions, Poitou and spread to the Low Countries (Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg).  French interpretations of Melusine legends involve the  House of Lusignan , whose members claim to be descended from Melusine. There are also folklore stating that the earliest castle of the House was built by the water spirit, Melusine.   Melusines may have come from the Poitevin legend of \"Mère Lusine,\" leader of a band of fairies associated with building Roman structures in the countryside.   The names of Melusines seem to be based on fairies around the world. For example,  Cosanzeana  is a Romanian fairy,  Aeval  and  Elphane  are based on Celtic fae, while  Sigewinne  is derived from a water spirit mentioned in the Middle High German epic  Ortnit .   After giving a negative review to the Seven Nations Gazette,  Neuvillette  was speculated by that tabloid to be the only male Melusine.

Oceanid           Rhodeia of Loch , a full sized Oceanid in her true form       Type   Species Lore       Region   Fontaine       The  Oceanids , occasionally called the  Lochfolk , are a species made of pure Hydro energy originating from  Fontaine . They are able to control water and mimic real life forms with water.    Contents     1   Overview   2   Powers and Abilities   3   Known Oceanids     3.1   Uncertain Members   3.2   Other       4   Trivia     4.1   Etymology       5   Other Languages   6   Change History   7   References       Overview [ ]   The Oceanids originate from Fontaine and are devotees of  Egeria , the previous Hydro Archon. According to the Ancient Natural History Excerpts in the  Institute of Natural Philosophy , legends say that Egeria shed the \"first tear\", which gave birth to the first Oceanid, from which all other Oceanids were born. [1]  She tasked the Oceanids with spreading all over  Teyvat  as spies, not out of any malicious intent, but rather as a way to connect everyone similar to how water is connected throughout the continent. Some of these Oceanids saw human life and envied them, asking Egeria to grant them the ability to do so. Egeria did so by siphoning water from the  Primordial Sea  and injecting it into the Oceanids' blood vessels, creating humanoid forms for them. This act was seen as a \"sin\" by the  Heavenly Principles , who decreed a  prophecy  that the people of Fontaine would dissolve into water and leave the Hydro Archon weeping on the throne by herself.  At some point after Egeria's death during the  cataclysm , the Oceanids fled Fontaine. According to  Idyia , they did so because the waters changed and became full of pain and hatred. [2]  However,  Rhodeia  implies that some, like her, left because they didn't want to accept  Focalors  as the new Hydro Archon and wanted to \"keep the dreams of yesteryear alive\". [3]  The coming and death of  Elynas  was specified to taint Fontaine's lands and waters, and although Fontaine researchers promised that the pollution had been cleansed, this factor may contribute to the current status of Fontaine's waters. [4]   During their self-imposed exile, the Oceanids came to  Tunigi Hollow  in search of their master. However, after seeing that the  Harvisptokhm  was not what they had hoped to find, they scattered in different directions. People followed their pilgrimage trail, eventually establishing the  Purification Spring  domain.  The descendants of the transformed Oceanids were later absolved of sin and made \"true humans\" by the  Hydro Dragon ,  Neuvillette , after his Authority was restored when  Focalors  executed herself through the death sentence rendered by the  Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale  and thus destroying the Hydro Archon's divine authority and heavenly throne; people caught in the waters after his verdict were not dissipated into water, however, the people dissolved prior to this did not return.    Powers and Abilities [ ]   Oceanids are able to float through the air, and are capable of achieving significant speeds. In combat they manipulate water, both to fire a variety of Hydro attacks and to create  creatures  formed out of water. As seen with  Idyia  and  Callirhoe , they can also mimic a human form, though they will be afflicted with  Hydro  under  Elemental Sight . Particularly powerful Oceanids who possess both wisdom and compassion are able to create Oceanid manifestations which can replicate other humans, much like Idyia did with her past human companions in the  Veluriyam Mirage . [5] [6]   An Oceanid's growth is very different from other creatures'. Separating from the others and departing from their homeland apparently causes them to lose much of their intelligence and ability, though they can restore it over time. [7]  Oceanids learn and gain intelligence mainly by joining with water sources, such as bodies of water, or even tears. One of the most potent sources is the water creatures created by another Oceanid. [8]  They can also gain some intelligence by looking upon the moon's reflection in the water. [7]   The secret to Oceanid reproduction is only known to Oceanids. However, according to the Ancient Natural History Excerpts, Oceanids must first approach the Hydro Archon or an elder for permission to claim the \"Helixsplit,\" which allows them to split into little Oceanids. The exact nature of what the Helixsplit is remains unknown to humans. [1]  Caterpillar speculates that Oceanid reproduction is accomplished through imagination and mimicry—when an Oceanid \"imagines the path that could have been taken,\" a new Oceanid may be born. This appears to be the case with  Ann , who was born when the merged consciousness of the Oceanid  Lyris  and  Mary-Ann Guillotin  dreamed of living forever in a simple, fairytale-like world. [6]   Oceanids are also capable of merging with each other and becoming a single, more powerful Oceanid. Most Oceanids seem to see this as something positive or normal, though some like Ann are upset by it. However, they must still be careful as it is supposedly possible for an Oceanid's mind to be shattered if they join with a smaller but wicked mind. [3]   Oceanids are born from the water's essence. [9]  They can control and manipulate water, but they are also affected by changes in the water. For example, Rhodeia's enmity towards  Endora  turned the water connected to her pool bitter, which nearly killed the younger Oceanid. Endora was able to recover by taking in the sweet water from Springvale's spring, which was home to a  friendlier Oceanid .

[11]   Other [ ]   All Fontanians that were dissolved through Water from the Primordial Sea as a result of its power escaping their blood vessels would return to the Sea. but their consciousness would remain and take form of an Oceanid [12] . As seeing with  Vacher 's victims and  Poisson  flood victims, they can merge into a collective consciousness, forming an only Oceanid [13] . It is unknown if they share another power with Oceanids beyond their appearance and ability to merge.   Trivia [ ]   The Spring Fairy's blessing is the reason why Diona's drinks always taste delicious, no matter how disgusting the ingredients or flavor combinations are. [14]  It is unclear whether all Oceanids are capable of giving out blessings, as no other Oceanids introduced in the story have been mentioned or shown to have such an ability.   The Oceanids, similarly to the  Melusine , are technically a genderless race who have been shown as females. Although Hydro Mimics and Eidolons have been shown taking male forms, they seem to only do so when pretending to be a specific human.  The  Master  of the  Narzissenkreuz Ordo  is the first known male Oceanid, but as he was an Oceanid created by a human, Master may not be affiliated with the original Oceanid race.   The English and Thai localizations are the only two languages to make a distinction between \"Lochfolk\" and \"Oceanid.\" A translation note in the Thai dialogue of  Life Flows On (I)  claims that \"Oceanid\" is the name which outsiders use for Lochfolk, although this has been left unexplained in English. [15]   The Oceanids' form resemble real-life  sea angels , which may have been the inspiration for their design. Oceanids joining or binding together may be a reference to sea angels binding while mating and hunting together.   Etymology [ ]   The term Oceanid is derived from the  Oceanids  in Greek mythology, who were nymphs of springs; they have a male equivalent known as the  Potamoi , who were the gods of rivers and streams.  Rhodeia, Urania, Ianeira, Idyia, Lyris, and Callirhoe's names are directly lifted from those of Greek Oceanids, whereas Endora's name has no exact match but may be based off the Oceanid Eudora.   The term Lochfolk is a portmanteau of  loch  (lake) +  folk .

Saurian           From left to right: a Yumkasaurus, a Tepetlisaurus, and a Koholasaurus       Type   Species Lore       Region   Natlan       Saurians  ( -saurus ,  plural   -sauri ) [1]  are the  dragons  of  Natlan . They have undergone long years of development and evolution, and unlike dragons in other nations of  Teyvat , Saurians are common in Natlan and closely coexist with humanity.

[3]  It appears that Saurians can choose their human companion and refuse to team up with anyone they don't acknowledge, as seen in the tale of  Kuntur , who was ostracized by humans and Saurians alike until he accomplished something great and earned the recognition of an Iktomisaurus comrade. [4]   Yumkasaurs are known to have a life span roughly under that of a century. If they live longer than that, it is considered unnatural, with the Yumkasaur  Kongamato  living much longer, highly suspected to be from  Abyssal  contamination. [5]  According to various signboards in the Scions' village, young Yumkasaurs enjoy being touched by their ears, but dislike having their tails groomed. Adult Yumkasaurs enjoy having their tails groomed, showing it off with pride.  While humans and Saurians live in harmony in the current era, this does not appear to have always been the case, with at least some Saurians being subservient to and abused by people from Natlan. For example, a man was condemned to death for protecting his tribe's Saurians some time in the past. [6]  There are also groups that poach Saurians.  Saurians breathe fire. [1]   Some Saurians like  Little One  can be born with a distinctive red mark, which is known as the  Flamelord's Blessing . Saurians with this mark are noted to have much stronger powers over normal Saurians, and they are considered by the people of Natlan to be dangerous, as Saurians imbued with such power either succumb to it or become insane, which causes the  Wayob  and  Night Kingdom  to also reject them. The tribe that is related to the Saurian with the mark are \"dealt with\" by sending them back to the Night Kingdom. If this option is not chosen, the Saurian and their companion could instead travel to the  Great Volcano of Tollan  to perform a ritual by washing the name of the companion as remembered by the Fallen Dragon Xiuhcoatl to allow the Night Kingdom to accept them once more, though by the present era, this ritual was considered outdated due to a near nonexistent rate of success.    Varieties [ ]   Historical [ ]   Stegosaur   An individual Stegosaur named Muhuru [7]  accompanied the warrior  Sundjatta  during Tenoch's campaign against the Abyss. [8]   Present Day [ ]   There are 6 current varieties of Saurians in Natlan:    Tepetlisaur     They live in the  mines of eastern Natlan , alongside the  Nanatzcayan  people. [9]  Their  young  are characterized by round eyes and round bellies. [1]   Iktomisaur   [4]   They have the ability to fly [1]  by floating up and making themselves as light as a feather [10]  and live alongside the  Mictlan  people of Natlan's western cliffs. An individual Iktomisaur named Mahamba accompanied the warrior  Sanhaj  during Tenoch's campaign against the Abyss. [8]   Koholasaur     They live alongside the  Meztli  people of Natlan's  southern springs .   Yumkasaur     They live alongside the  Huitztlan  people of the  trees of southeastern Natlan . An individual Yumkasaur named  Kongamato , also known as the Mountain King, accompanied the warrior  Burkina  during Tenoch's campaign against the Abyss. [8]   Qucusaur   They live alongside the  Tlalocan  people of Natlan's northwestern mountain peaks. An individual Qucusaur, known as  Holawaqa Ngoubou , accompanied the warrior  Menilek  during Tenoch's campaign against the Abyss. [8]   Tatankasaur   They live alongside the  Collective of Plenty  in Natlan's southwest. An individual Tatankasaur named Kayeke accompanied the warrior  Wanjiru  during Tenoch's campaign against the Abyss.

Long-Necked Rhinos  are not considered Saurians.   Etymology [ ]   In zoology, \" saurian \" is used to refer to any species under the sub-order  Sauria , a taxonomic class which includes all modern reptiles and similarly extinct ones. The word saurian itself derives from the Ancient Greek word  σαῦρος   saûros  meaning \"lizard.\"   Iktomi  is a spider trickster spirit in Lakota mythology.   Tepetl  means \"mountain\" in the Nahuatl language.   Koholā  means \"humpback whale\" in the Hawaiian language.   Tatanka  means \"buffalo bull\" in the Lakota language.   Yumká  is a forest-dwelling elf in  Chontal Mayan  culture.  Yum Kaax  means \"lord of the forest\" in the Yucatec Mayan language, and is also a god in Mayan culture.   The name Qucusaur may derive from Qucumatz (standardly spelled  Qʼuqʼumatz ), the  Feathered Serpent  god of wind and rain of  Kʼicheʼ Maya , where  qʼuqʼ  means \"quetzal\" in the Kʼicheʼ language.

    "Seelie": "Seelie           Mysterious Seelie       Type   Exploration Lore Species       World   Teyvat       Seelie  (plural Seelie) are the devolved form of  Angels [1]  that can be found throughout  Teyvat . Each Seelie belongs to its respective Seelie Court, a statue the Seelie seem to finally rest at. Electro Seelie will instead \"generate\" their own court once they reach their destination.  Seelie can often be found around treasure, puzzles, or locations of interest. Seelie and Seelie Courts can be out in the open or hidden behind breakable objects, such as the large rock formations with cracks in them.  Chests  will appear once the Seelie has settled back into the court. The player can activate their  Elemental Sight  near an empty Seelie Court and a blue trail will lead in the direction that the Seelie currently is and vice versa. Seelie will return to their starting location if they have not been led back to their court after a certain amount of time.

The ancestor of the Seelie once met a traveler from afar, with whom they married. Their marriage was witnessed by the  three sisters  of the Lunar Palace — Aria, Sonnet, and Canon. Thirty days after the union, a disaster struck; the Seelie and their lover fled into exile, but the disaster eventually caught up with them. As punishment, they were separated, and their memories were wiped. [4]   Their previous form, voice, and wisdom are now lost, and now all they will offer is small treasures to those willing to follow them.  Old  Aranara  stories claim this fate befell the Seelie because they were cursed at birth to lose their intelligence and form if they ever fell in love with humans. Furthermore, according to  Arama , there was at least one \"survivor\" of the fall, who came to dwell in \"the golden desert,\" befriended Queen Aranyani ( Greater Lord Rukkhadevata ) and the ruler of the desert ( King Deshret ). [6]  It is possible that this survivor was  Nabu Malikata , the Goddess of Flowers, who was friends with both figures.  Other named angels who survived the devolution of their kin include  Sybilla  of  Remuria [7]  and  Yohualtecuhtin  of the  Night Kingdom [1]     Other Types [ ]   Warming Seelie [ ]               In  Dragonspine , a unique type of Seelie have evolved to survive the harsh colds. [8]  These Seelie are different to the average Seelie, having a red appearance resembling flames. They produce enough heat to keep nearby travelers warm and insulated from  Sheer Cold .  Additionally, once settled in their Seelie Courts, the Warming Seelie will continue to produce heat.  The  Warming Bottle  that players can craft were made to imitate the heat that Warming Seelie produce, to better help adventurers survive in cold climates.      Electro Seelie [ ]               In  Inazuma , Electro Seelie are a variant that moves at a high speed when the player moves close to them. Upon approaching it, it will unleash an Electro shockwave that applies a non-volatile Electro element to nearby players and enemies. This Electro application does not deal DMG and is incapable of causing  Elemental Reactions .  Electro Seelie may also appear as part of other puzzles. These Electro Seelie do not wait for player proximity, come to rest in a Seelie Court, or lead directly to chests as usual. Instead, they fly in a path to help the player solve a puzzle, such as indicating the order in which to light up  Elemental Monuments . They may appear when a mechanism is activated and disappear at the end of their path, or they may persist and only disappear when the puzzle is completed.      Luminous Seelie [ ]               In the unique climate of the  Underground Mines  of  The Chasm , Seelie have mutated to Luminous Seelie. Being close to a Luminous Seelie will gradually recharge the  Lumenstone Adjuvant 's energy. They can also activate  Lumentorches  when nearby.      Seelie of Life [ ]                 Seelie of Life ( unofficial name ) appear in  Withering Zones  and have the same effects as  Candles of Life . They will remove units of Decay when in close proximity.      Mini Seelie [ ]   Main article:  Mini Seelie                 Mini Seelie appear to be infant versions of the Seelie. They only have the \"head\" part of an adult Seelie and do not possess the pointed lower body, the flowing \"scarf,\" or the two trailing whiskers. They also lack the typical chime-like sounds associated with the presence of an adult Seelie, instead occasionally bursting out with very excited squeaky noises.  A notable one is a  Treasure-Seeking Seelie , which actively searches for treasures (namely  Iron Coins ) instead of going back to their Court.  Ulman  formerly had one who aided him but unfortunately stopped responding to him, and he instead lent it to the Traveler (whom the Mini Seelie was rather fond of).  By attaining enough Silver Coins, one of the variations of Mini Seelie can be exchanged. Unlike the Treasure Seeking Seelie, these Seelie have an idle animation and make noises.    Monetoo [ ]   Main article:  Monetoo   Although not a type of Seelie per se, Monetoo are a Natlanese equivalent of Seelie, functioning practically the same as Mysterious Seelie. Their main difference is that their resting place is an incomplete mural instead of a Seelie court. Just like Seelie, a Monetoo's location can be approximated by using Elemental Sight next to its mural.      Locations [ ]   An interactive map of Seelie locations can be found on the  Teyvat Interactive Map . Videos of their locations, including their Courts, can be found  here .  There are currently 602 Seelie (466 Mysterious Seelie, 33 Warming Seelie, 73 Electro Seelie, 30 Luminous Seelie) and 40 Monetoo throughout the land of Teyvat:    51 Seelie in  Mondstadt   After version 1.2, the Seelie located east of the Temple of the Falcon no longer counts towards achievement; the total is 52 if Travelers followed this Seelie prior to version 1.2.

These 3 Seelie count towards the  Lithic Guide  achievement.   14 Seelie are available during the  Three Realms Gateway Offering  event. These Seelie  do not  count towards the  Phosphoros' Guidance  achievement.   Trivia [ ]   They resemble a  will-o'-the-wisp  from classic folklore. They also resemble  sea angels  in terms of appearance.   The Seelie Courts in  Enkanomiya ,  The Chasm ,  The Chasm: Underground Mines , the  Great Red Sand , the  Desert of Hadramaveth , and the  Girdle of the Sands  are still intact — not broken or ruined — unlike most Seelie Courts in  Teyvat .   When Seelie settle in a damaged court, the court will be repaired. However, this sometimes will not occur. It is unknown whether or not this behavior is intended.  This is also the case when the player returns to a court that had repaired itself upon a Seelie's arrival, which will appear broken again upon return.   There is currently a bug in-game that will incorrectly count progress towards the  Guiding Wind  and  Lithic Guide  achievements sets, where the game may miss a Seelie that has already been followed back to their court or may count some additional times.   These  loading screen  tips relate to the Seelie:  \"Now you see them; now you don't. Once a mighty race that lived to guide mankind, now the most Seelie offer is a little treasure to willing followers.\"   \"Seelie all want to return to their Seelie Courts. If you see the remains of a small statue like this, you can use Elemental Sight to find traces of the Seelie...\"   \"Dragonspine's unique climate has caused even the Seelie to mutate. The gentle warmth of a Warming Seelie can help alleviate the effects of the bitter cold. Perhaps its warmth can also be used to trigger mechanisms...\"   \"The Chasm's unique climate has caused even the Seelie to mutate. Being close to a Luminous Seelie will gradually recharge the Lumenstone Adjuvant's energy. The light from such a Seelie can also activate some devices.\"   Etymology [ ]   The Seelie and their statues are named after the  Seelie Courts  of Scottish Folklore. They are described as fairies who seek help from humans and would return kindness favors of their own. The behavior of the Seelie in Genshin Impact (rewarding with treasures if they are followed back to their statues) alludes to this folklore.

Originally hailing from  Tighnar , they lived in the  Great Red Sand  during the era of  King Deshret 's civilization and remained there for over a century after his death, until constant warring between  Eremite  tribes led them to move to  Dharma Forest . [1]   Tighnari  is their descendant, named after them.

While people came to associate Tighnarians with Tulaytullah, [3]  they actually came from Tighnar and only settled in Tulaytullah following King Deshret's death. [1]   After moving to the rainforest, the  Aranara  gave the Tighnarians the name  \"Valuka Shuna\" , meaning \"large desert dog\" in the  Aranara Language  — despite the fact that Tighnarians more closely resembled foxes. [4]   While  Hermanubis , a Tighnarian, held  Electro -based powers while he was alive, it is unclear whether all Tighnarians had elemental abilities, or if this was a unique trait bestowed upon him as King Deshret's familiar.    Appearance [ ]   Hermanubis, currently the only example of a \"true\" Tighnarian, [Note 1]  had a jackal-like head but a humanlike body.  Mortal descendants of Tighnarians have inherited some Tighnarian traits, implicitly due to intermarriage. They have large ears reminiscent of  fennec foxes ', as well as bushy tails, but otherwise have human features. [4]   When they resided in the desert, Tighnarians' hair and fur were light in color to help with heat tolerance, but as they adapted to their new lives in the rainforest, they developed darker green fur. This dark fur has caused some Tighnarian descendants to have particularly low heat tolerance. [4] [5]     Story [ ]   King Deshret's Era [ ]   Given the lack of information about Tighnar, little is known about the Tighnarians' origins. Hermanubis was said to have been a \"warrior of Tighnar\" who came from the \"barren desert sands\" to serve King Deshret, [1]  and given that Deshret \"chose the sage Hermanubis from among the Tighnarians\" to be his familiar, many — if not all — the Tighnarians became Deshret's followers. [2]  While Deshret was alive, most of his priests were Tighnarians. [6]     After King Deshret's Death [ ]   Following King Deshret's death, the Tighnarian priests followed Hermanubis to  Tulaytullah , where they founded the  Temple of Silence  to preserve the knowledge that survived the fall of Deshret's civilization. Little over a hundred years later, the various desert city-states descended into war. While Tulaytullah managed to remain stable for a while, war eventually came to them. A king of  Gurabad  besieged Tulaytullah, demanding the Temple of Silence be handed over to him as proof of his victory. To secure their own positions, the ruling elite of the city colluded with him by antagonizing the Temple of Silence as the true source of the chaos. By this point, Hermanubis had exhausted his strength trying to keep  forbidden knowledge , introduced to the Great Red Sand by Deshret before his death, at bay. To safeguard the Temple, Hermanubis split himself into many parts called Ba fragments, which granted his power to members of the Temple of Silence. [1]   Though this new power was able to drive away the invading Gurabad army, the people of Tulaytullah were wary of this strange phenomenon and shunned the Temple of Silence. Because of that, the Temple and the Tulaytullah Tighnarians abandoned the city and the desert altogether, choosing to carefully make their way to the rainforest to preserve their knowledge [1]  by forming an alliance with the  Sumeru Akademiya . [7]  In their historical traditions, Tighnarian descendants claim that their survival was due to  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata 's grace, which also turned their fur green. [4]     400 Years Ago to Present [ ]   For the next several centuries, the Temple of Silence and the Tulaytullah Tighnarians lived peacefully in the rainforest, successfully forming a partnership with Sumeru Akademiya in order to preserve their knowledge. However, after Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death during the  cataclysm  500 years ago, the Sages who controlled the Akademiya grew corrupt. A hundred years later, the Temple of Silence's members deemed the Sages untrustworthy and quietly ended their partnership. While some members decided to return to the desert, [7]  most Tighnarians decided to remain in the rainforest. [2]   Tighnarian descendants can still be found around Sumeru to this day, such as Tighnari and his ancestry.    Known Tighnarians [ ]   Hermanubis   Tighnarian Descendants [ ]   Tighnari's father and mother [4]   Tighnari   Notes [ ]     ↑   \"'True' Tighnarian\" is an unofficial distinction used to delineate Tighnarians from their descendants. In  Tighnari's Character Story 5 , Tighnari is stated to have \"ancestors [who] had lived alongside the Valuka Shuna [...] inheriting some of their traits,\" indicating that he is more human than Tighnarian.

Some of their traces may be left on  Yashiori Island  as well. [1]  They are huge, intelligent sea creatures that have gone extinct in most ocean regions. They are considered to be the arch-nemesis of all sailors, and it is said that they often attack cargo ships on long voyages and rob fishermen of their catch. For this reason, many Umibouzu are hunted down and killed by humans. In an unusual phenomenon, the Umibouzu near  Watatsumi Island  have grown close to humanity. [2]   The people of Watatsumi do not have a common name for the species, and instead name each creature individually. One such example is  Kumi  naming her friend \"Kuntira.\" They believe that each Umibouzu is a lonely individual, just like humans. [2]   Though Kuntira was believed to be the last of her kind, the researcher  Anisa  discovered that she actually had multiple offspring before her death, and resolves to befriend them during her stay on Watatsumi Island.

Since the Japanese folklore has a variety of fox legends, the English word \" kitsune \" mainly refers to Japanese fox spirits to emphasize this aspect, although the original Japanese word  kitsune  does not have such a connotation.   The original Chinese version uses a word that simply means \"fox,\" as well as Japanese and Korean versions. Thus in Teyvat, the most common sense of \"fox\" may be the kitsune (rather than the  crimson fox ), just as in the real world, the word \"fox\" usually refers to the red fox.

According to  Shiki Taishou , the oni clans value their principles and pride very much. [1]   Since the events of the  cataclysm , the blood of the oni has diluted with each passing day.

[4]  In the long distant past, the oni had completely blue or crimson skin color without any markings, although as they continued to reproduce with humans, their skin became similar to theirs, so oni typically paint markings on their skin and horns to indicate which tribe they hailed from. This signified how diluted the blood of the oni had become today. [2]   Judging by the appearance of the  Oni Mask  and the guard of the  Maguu Kenki , the Oni of Old used to have crooked faces and fangs.    Powers and Abilities [ ]   Oni are particularly powerful in terms of raw strength, as shown with Itto's appearance and combat style. It is said that an  Oni Mask  possesses immense power. [2]   One of the oni's weaknesses are beans, which is lethal to them in large amounts. For part-oni, they do not suffer as much due to their oni blood being significantly thinned, but Itto is a lone exception to this.    History [ ]   Early History [ ]   The oni are some of Inazuma's inhabitants, although they lived a mostly secluded lifestyle as humans feared them. An Inazuman fairytale speaks of two oni; a blue oni, who preferred seclusion, and a crimson oni, who wished to socialize with humans. The crimson oni's initial attempts to interact with humans ended in failure, but they still wished to befriend the humans. The blue oni then proposed a solution in which he would perform \"evil\" acts and have the crimson oni scare him off. The plan worked and the crimson oni began to interact with humans. Seeing this, the blue oni left. Eventually, the crimson oni searched for the blue oni; upon realizing that the blue oni was purposely avoiding him, the crimson oni left behind a letter and they reunited during a village festival, albeit away from the village.  Onis are more versed in the story as it held a hidden truth that most people were unaware of - the oni, being the proud race they were, wanted the Shogun's protection, but in order to do so, they had to have a good relationship with the humans. People at the time did not discern between oni, so they treated all of them the same, which was mostly exacerbated by the blue oni continually clashing with the humans, while the crimson oni tried to maintain good relationships with them. As a result, the two tribes met and issued a pact - the blue oni would help the crimson oni integrate with humans as long as the crimson oni would treat humans respectfully, not use their strength for malicious intents and obtain the respect of the humans.  As the blue oni remained in a life of seclusion, they were eventually thought to have died off.    The Cataclysm [ ]   500 years before the start of the game, the  cataclysm  erupted throughout Teyvat;  Mikoshi Chiyo , one of Ei's friends, was swallowed by a beast of sin. While she broke out, she was corrupted by its influence and rebelled against the Shogunate, prompting Ei to cut her sword arm and one horn off, but she was spared and fled into the forests. Chiyo's son, Iwakura Michihiro, was shamed by his mother's actions and led a life of seclusion in  Konda Village  until he met  Teruyo  of the  Yougou Tengu .    Present Day [ ]   In the current day, the crimson and blue oni tribes continue to exist;  Arataki Itto  is the current representative of the crimson oni. The blue oni were also revealed to have survived, albeit in extremely poor conditions, forcing one of them,  Takuya , to join a vagrant group for supplies. During Itto's  Story Quest , he manages to connect to Takuya and now learning of their suffering, pledges to assist the blue oni tribe however he can after being released from jail. The  Traveler  informed  Granny Oni  of this, who began making preparations to help the blue oni.

Oni mask from Maguu Kenki Version 1.6 Website   In Japanese mythology,  oni  are a kind of horned ogre-like creature, usually portrayed as demonic evil spirits.   Oni are supposedly allergic to beans. [3]   This might be a reference to the real-world Japanese holiday  Setsubun , where beans are believed to have the ability to purify one's home and are thrown at people disguised as oni to ward off evil spirits and bring in good fortune for the upcoming year.

All known tengus have had crow masks affixed on their head.  Akuou  mentions beating the  Great Tengu  at the time and taking his mask as a trophy, implying that the masks of the tengu are either of great honor or importance, or even essential to their survival.    Powers and Abilities [ ]   The tengu appear to be well-versed in both archery and swordsmanship, although their arts are not restricted to those within their clans. The Great Tengu taught the human  Takamine  her archery techniques, which he later taught to  Asase Hibiki . [1] [3] [4]   Another member of the  Yougou Three , the onmyouji  Kamuna Harunosuke , learned the tengu art of transcension while training under the  Yougou Tengu ; which he combined with his knowledge of  Liyue   adepti  arts to create  onmyoudou . [5] [6]   A tengu's speed is said to be nearly unrivaled.  Kitsune Saiguu  technically won a race against the Chieftain of the Yougou Tengu but believes that the tengu went easy on her, [7]  while  Iwakura Michihiro 's grazing of Teruyo's wing during a duel won him the name \"Tengu Victor.\" [1]   According to Teruyo, a name given by the Yougou possesses divine powers. [1]  It is unclear whether this is an ability possessed by all tengu or only the Yougou Tengu.  Tengu warriors are known to possess magical items known as feather fans. When wielded by a tengu, a feather fan can have various effects; while in the hands of ordinary people, it is only capable of \"making one's body lighter\" when in mid-air (such that it increases one's movement speed while gliding). [8]   While tengu are slimmer than oni, they are far stronger than their appearance suggests.    History [ ]   Early History [ ]   The tengu are some of Inazuma's inhabitants and lived a mostly secluded lifestyle. One tengu,  Sasayuri , was acquainted with  Ei ; during the war against Watatsumi when  Orobashi  inexplicably invaded Shogunate-held islands, he was slain in battle. At some point, the Great Tengu  Reizenbou  was gifted the  Thundering Pulse  by the Shogun. It is unclear whether it was  Makoto  or  Ei  who gave the gift.    The Cataclysm [ ]   During the  cataclysm , Teruyo met  Mikoshi Doukei , who was living a life of self-exile in  Konda Village  as a result of his mother's actions against the Shogun. Teruyo later disappeared after Doukei managed to graze her wing, asking him to forget about her. The \"Great Tengu\",  Kitsune Saiguu 's protector, also disappeared during this time.    Present Day [ ]   Like the oni, most tengu continue to live in seclusion. Prior to the Traveler's arrival in  Inazuma , there are at least two tengu - an unnamed tengu that  Arataki Itto  had dueled in  Byakko Plain , and  Kujou Sara , who was integrated into human society after falling from a great height while battling monsters and fell unconscious when she was discovered, having been saved by her recently granted  Vision .    Known Tengus [ ]   Playable Characters [ ]    Kujou Sara   Other Characters [ ]   4   Characters  match the category selection:   Reizenbou   Sasayuri   Teruyo   Yoichi   Known Members [ ]   See also:  Category:Tengu   Unknown Time Period [ ]   Sasayuri  (deceased)   Yoichi   500 Years Ago [ ]   The \"Great Tengu\"  Reizenbou [9]  ( Kitsune Saiguu 's protector; deceased) [10] [11]   Teruyo  (member of the  Yougou Tengu ; disappeared) [1]   Present [ ]   Kujou Sara [2]   Trivia [ ]   In Japanese mythology,  tengu  are a kind of supernatural creature; they are classical youkai that may also be revered as deities (kami) in Shinto. In Japanese Buddhism, the tengu were seen as tricksters and destructive demons of war, but could also take on a noble, protective role.  The association with crows in  Genshin Impact 's depiction of tengu is derived from a variant of the creature known as  karasu-tengu  ( Japanese :  烏天狗  \"crow tengu\" ; also called  kotengu , \"lesser tengu\"). Compared to the archetypal humanoid  daitengu  ( Japanese :  大天狗  \"great tengu\" ), karasu-tengu are depicted with more corvid-like characteristics, and are perceived as lesser beings to daitengu; despite their appearance pre-dating them.   The masks worn by Inazuman tengu appear to combine aspects of both the daitengu and karasu-tengu; such as the bird-like appearance of a karasu-tengu's head, and the daitengu's characteristic red face and long nose (which has been interpreted as a beak). Kujou Sara's mask bears a hexagonal shape resembling a  tokin ; a piece of headwear from the garb worn by  yamabushi , as well as tengu in the guise of them.   In  Raiden Shogun 's \"Good Evening\"  voice-over , the  Traveler  remarks that they used to be a shooting star, to which Ei asks whether they might be a tengu warrior. [12]  This directly references a separate creature in Chinese mythology known as  tiangou  ( Chinese :  天狗   tiāngǒu , \"Heavenly Dog\" ), a canine monster that takes the form of a shooting star or comet. The Chinese characters for  tiāngǒu  are the same kanji used to write  tengu  in Japanese, though the actual relationship between the two is unclear.

Akademiya Extravaganza     Type   Sumeru Culture Festivals       The  Akademiya Extravaganza  is a festival in  Sumeru  run by the Akademiya. It consists of the Wisdom Gala and the Interdarshan Championship.

During this time, all six  Darshans  will set up booths throughout  Sumeru City  for showcase purposes to attract potential students. These booths often include minigames and other activities.  Deciding what to showcase is a point of contention for some Darshans, as they can encounter difficulties figuring out appropriate yet appealing activities.    Interdarshan Championship [ ]   The Interdarshan Championship is held once every four years. Each Darshan selects one representative to participate, and the participants compete to become champion of the entire competition and thus earn rewards. In the twenty years preceding and including A Parade of Providence, one of the greatest rewards was the right to wear the  Diadem of Knowledge , a valuable treasure widely regarded as a work of art.    Participants [ ]   Participants must belong to a Darshan. Both current students and alumni are eligible. Participants can self-nominate or be nominated by over half of their Darshan; those who are nominated can decline participation. Sages cannot participate, and participants may only participate in one Championship. [1]  It is unknown if those who were expelled, were otherwise removed, or dropped out before graduation are eligible to become participants. It is also unknown who selects the participants.  Known participants include:    Kaveh's father  (Rtawahist, 20 years ago) — finished second   Huvishka 's friend (Darshan unknown, 20 years ago)   Tighnari  (Amurta, during A Parade of Providence)   Faruzan  (Haravatat, during A Parade of Providence)   Kaveh  (Kshahrewar, during A Parade of Providence) — champion   Layla  (Rtawahist, during A Parade of Providence)   Cyno  (Spantamad, during A Parade of Providence)   Wanderer  as Hat Guy (Vahumana, during A Parade of Providence)   History [ ]   Not much is currently known about the history of the Wisdom Gala or that of the Akademiya Extravaganza prior to twenty years ago.  According to Huvishka, the  Spantamad  Darshan has had the highest percentage of winners in the championships history. He also claims that the most thrilling competition occurred 20 years ago.  Events in which participants fought to the death were included in the Interdarshan Championship up until the one held twenty years before the events of  A Parade of Providence .    20 Years before A Parade of Providence [ ]   Shortly before an Akademiya Extravaganza was to be held,  Sachin  donated or entrusted all of his assets to Sumeru Akademiya. Included among his donations was the  Diadem of Knowledge , a valuable treasure that Sachin declared would only be worn by the winner of an Interdarshan Championship. To celebrate, the Akademiya Extravaganza hosted after Sachin's donation was a larger celebration than usual. [2] [3]   The Extravaganza that year included the Interdarshan Championship, and  Kaveh's father  and  Huvishka 's friend participated in it.  Kaveh's father became a favorite to win the Interdarshan Championship, but he did not win. [4]  It is implied that in the final round, he encountered the fragment of  Sachin 's consciousness stored in the Diadem of Knowledge and was negatively affected enough that Arakasyapa, who still remembered Kaveh's father and happened to be nearby, took the Diadem of Knowledge and hid it in a tree hollow, [3] [5] [6] [7] [8] [Note 1]  where it would later be found by the employee who was in charge of the Diadem of Knowledge. [9]  However, the damage had already been done, and Kaveh's father fell into depression. [6]   Exactly what happened during the final round, held in Avidya Forest, is unknown, partly because \"no one dared to approach\" the participants. The Akademiya eventually shut down the competition and later removed many of the events that caused participants to fight to the death, implying that whatever happened in the final round had been tragic or nearly so. [9]  It is unknown if there was any winner to that Interdarshan Championship.    A Parade of Providence [ ]   Main article:  A Parade of Providence/Story   As a result of the change to Sumeru's leadership following the events of  Archon Quest   Chapter III , the Akademiya Extravaganza held during A Parade of Providence was of great importance to Sumeru Akademiya. Due to the long oppression suffered by desert-dwellers prior to the change in Sumeru's leadership, Lesser Lord Kusanali and the sages decided to specifically invite many of them, such as  Candace  and  Dehya  to the Extravaganza in hopes of having them enjoy the Akademiya's atmosphere. They also recruited  Nilou , the  Traveler , and  Paimon , none of whom are from the Akademiya, as guest commentators in hopes of having the Interdarshan Championship appeal to more people. [1]   The Extravaganza included the Interdarshan Championship, and its participants were  Tighnari ,  Faruzan ,  Kaveh ,  Layla ,  Cyno , and the  Wanderer .  Alhaitham , Nilou, the Traveler, and Paimon were guest commentators. The rewards included money, research funding, a limited-edition  Genius Invokation TCG  card, and the right to wear the Diadem of Knowledge as usual. [1]   There were three rounds as follows:    Find Swiftflies among the many butterflies that were intentionally released in  Sumeru City . Swiftflies look different from and are faster than ordinary butterflies.   Find Ley Line Disruptors, devices that mimic the effects of Ley Line disruptions, buried around  Aaru Village .   Find the Diadem of Knowledge and place it on a stand in  Mawtiyima Forest .   During the Championship, Sachin's son,  Jiwani , hired  Eremites  to kidnap his father, who he had grown to resent, as Jiwani thought his father was still alive. This plan was foiled by Wanderer and Alhaitham. [7]   The fragment of Sachin's consciousness in the Diadem of Knowledge finally saw a worthy successor in Kaveh and appeared at the end of the final round, after Kaveh won. However, Sachin's words upset Kaveh, who threw the Diadem of Knowledge to the ground, breaking it into pieces to ensure that no one else would ever have to hear Sachin or suffer from an experience with the Diadem of Knowledge again. [3]  As the recipient of Sachin's wealth, Kaveh also decided to donate all of it to help others. With the Diadem of Knowledge broken, the image of Sachin dissipated with a smile on his face. During the reward ceremony, Kaveh rejects all of the other rewards, except the  Genius Invokation TCG  card, which he gives to  Cyno , who then decides to buy it from him for 1 million Mora.  Nahida  later arrives to seal away Sachin's research, honoring Kaveh's wish for it not be disseminated, though she says that if someone else wants to take on Sachin's research in the future, she will not stop them because it is one step toward discovering the truth of the world. [7]     Akademiya Extravaganza Events [ ]   There is  1   Flagship Event  that has corresponded with the Akademiya Extravaganza.        Image    Name    Start    End    Version          A Parade of Providence     April 27, 2023    May 15, 2023    3.6     Notes [ ]     ↑   \"That Incident From Twenty Years Ago\"  indicates that after the final round, Arakasyapa hid the Diadem of Knowledge in a tree hole in order to protect the human who taught it how to read.  The Contestant  suggests that the human was the same human who helped Aaru Village and died in quicksand.  When the Curtains Close  shows that the human spoken of in  The Contestant  is Kaveh's father, as deduced by both the Traveler and Alhaitham. According to  Wiqas  in  Sachin's Article , the Diadem of Knowledge \"carries a secret that no one knows\"; the secret is likely related to the mental experience Kaveh had with Sachin's words and emotions due to the Diadem of Knowledge, as shown in  To Claim the Crown , explained by Kaveh himself in  The Arc of Intellect , and further supported by Kaveh's declaration in  When the Curtains Close  that with the diadem shattered, Sachin's words will never hurt anyone again. This makes it likely that Kaveh's father had the same experience as Kaveh.

    "Iridescence_Tour": "Iridescence Tour     Type   Festivals       The  Iridescence Tour  is an international music tour in  Teyvat  involving all seven nations. It was begun in  Fontaine .  Xinyan  was meant to attend it in  Inazuma , but it was cancelled suddenly. [1]  The organizers planned the show again, but this too ended up being cancelled, much to Xinyan's disappointment. [2]   Back in  Liyue , Xinyan bumps into  Dvorak  during the  Lantern Rite Festival . Dvorak had been visiting for personal reasons, but Xinyan convinces him to consider holding the Iridescence Tour there and then, even if it had been put off numerous times.

    "Nilotpala_Cup_Beast_Tamers_Tournament": "Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament     Type   Lore       Region   Sumeru       The  Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament  is a tournament that was held in  Sumeru . It was organized by  Kautilya , a senior  Amurta  researcher, and funded by  Elchingen , a businessman from  Fontaine . It boasts a prize pool of 60 million Mora, with another prize of  Elchingen 's entire fortune being given away to the person who wins the Ultimate Trial.  In the tournament, contestants are tasked with capturing Fungi, training them and then commanding them to fight with the  Wisdom Orb  that is provided by the organizers of the tournament.  The tournament features two  event domains :  Nilotpala Cup Special Training Grounds  and  Nilotpala Cup Official Arena . Both domains are found at the respective   icon on the map.    History [ ]   During the tournament, Elchingen was exposed as a  Fatuus  seeking to use the fungi to cause havoc in Sumeru, while Kautilya was exposed as a fraud for plagiarizing the Wisdom Orb from a previous design. However, the tournament was positively received, so responsibility for hosting the event in the future was passed to the  Traveler , the tournament's champion. However they decided that the tournament should be suspended for the time being until  The Akademiya  find a way to improve the design of Wisdom Orb.  After some time passed, the once-heated discussions around the first iteration of the event are slowly decreasing and the tournament is being forgotten. To prevent this from happening,  Haniyyah  and  Balfour  organized a thematic event to promote the next tournament called Fungus Mechanicus, based on  Theater Mechanicus  which Balfour bought the Sumeru franchising right of the game from Liyue. With the Traveler's permission, they would market this event as a spin-off of the tournament to attract more contestants and audience in the next tournament.

    "Sal_Vindagnyr": "Sal Vindagnyr               Type   Ancient Civilizations Lore       Region   Mondstadt       Sal Vindagnyr [1]  was an ancient, now ruined mountain kingdom located on the mountain of Vindagnyr, now known as  Dragonspine . Many of the  Hidden Exploration Objectives  and crafted  Weapons  from this area relate to the destruction of this ancient nation.    Contents     1   History     1.1   The Fall of Sal Vindagnyr   1.2   Legacy       2   Trivia     2.1   Etymology       3   Notes   4   Other Languages   5   Change History   6   References   7   Navigation       History [ ]   Several thousand years ago, a group of refugees from a land of snow and strife came upon a lush, green mountain. They erected a monument on its peak and established a civilization there, naming it Sal Vindagnyr. [2]  They built their capital city and palace, the  Entombed City - Ancient Palace , on the mountain. For a while, the kingdom prospered, and the people enjoyed the blessings of  Celestia . [1] [3] [Note 1]     The Fall of Sal Vindagnyr [ ]   This kingdom had a  large white tree  of great importance. Some years before the fall of Sal Vindagnyr, the chief priest  Varuch 's daughter, known simply as \" the princess ,\" was born beneath that tree. [Note 2]  The princess received certain blessings, which included the ability to foresee events in the future. [1]  She would often paint, and eventually started making frescoes; these frescoes contained depictions of what she foresaw. One day, she had a prophetic dream of a black dragon filling the land with a cloud of scarlet poison, and she took it as an omen of doom. [2]   Either around the same time or perhaps afterward, the  Skyfrost Nail  fell from Celestia for unknown reasons. This caused the city to be shrouded by clouds and mist, and causing snowstorms throughout the region. A hero from another land,  Imunlaukr , was living in this kingdom at the time, and was seemingly quite close with the princess. The princess gave him a greatsword made of  Starsilver , the  Snow-Tombed Starsilver , before he left to try and find a way to save the nation. She told him that she planned to dedicate her fourth fresco to him and that she'd wait for his return, but the snowstorm drowned out her words and Imunlaukr could not hear her. [4] [5]   Sometime after this point, the princess was working on a fresco when Varuch noticed that the trees were starting to wither. He decided to go up the mountain again to seek guidance, expecting his daughter to be finished with the second painting by then. He was certain that if the third painting was of thawing snow and ice, then everything would be fine. [6]  However, it had been so long since she had seen blue sky and green grass that she wasn't sure how to paint what her father wanted, and was unable to finish the fresco, partially due to other circumstances. [7]   During this time, the Skyfrost Nail mysteriously split in three pieces, a sight that was recorded in stone roughly halfway up the mountain. [2]  Afterward, these pieces seemingly fragmented further, releasing three orbs that froze the areas where they stopped: one deep in the Starglow Cavern, another in an underground chamber near the outskirts of the city, and the third shattered the white tree that was so important to that kingdom. [8]  The princess noticed this and picked the most complete branch, taking it to a small nearby island to try to graft it onto another tree. [1]  However, the tree withered under the snowstorm and the princess died next to it. [4]   The kingdom's scribe,  Ukko , [7] [9]  attempted to heal the ley lines, but they had withered already. Ukko then buried the princess and apparently went into Starglow Cavern, where they made another carving was found there. [2]  Ukko eventually died, their last words a curse towards the heavens and towards Imunlaukr, whom they believed had abandoned Sal Vindagnyr, [5]  and hoping that the \"new nation without gods\" would eventually have what it took to stood against this world. [9]   Sometime after the disaster, Imunlaukr returned from his fruitless search, only to discover that everyone had already died. This discovery left him disillusioned with  Celestia , and he vowed to \"help [them] pass the time with a song of iron and blood,\" leaving Sal Vindagnyr in search of a land full of war for him to fight in. He also abandoned the Snow-Tombed Starsilver in the  Mural Room , a chamber which depicts three murals — although one of the three murals is a direct copy of another. [4]     Legacy [ ]   Imunlaukr's life after leaving Sal Vindagnyr is unknown, but his descendants, the  Imunlaukr Clan , continued fighting bloody battles to entertain the gods. The Imunlaukr Clan lived around  Mondstadt  at the end of the  Archon War , which ended with  Boreas  and  Decarabian 's demise and the rise of  Barbatos  as the first and only  Anemo   Archon . They went on to become a prominent clan in Mondstadt that worshipped both Barbatos and the God of Time [10]  ( Istaroth ), [11]  alongside the  Gunnhildr Clan  and the  Lawrence Clan . [12]   During the  cataclysm  five hundred years ago, the princess' dream came true: the black, corrupted dragon  Durin  descended upon the land, where he was slain by  Dvalin  and his corrosive powers sealed using Vindagnyr's unnatural cold. As Durin's blood flowed into the land, the undying white tree spread its roots to absorb it. [1]  Meanwhile, the kingdom of  Khaenri'ah  entered a conflict against Celestia, only to emerge the loser. Its automatons, the  Ruin Machines , entered the region of Dragonspine. Some  Ruin Guards  can be found around the land, whose combined records can be deciphered to read  \"For the nation, we can't forgo this skyborne power, but we failed.\" [13]   After the  Traveler  shatters the ice surrounding the tree and offers it more of the dragon's energy in the form of  Crimson Agate , the now  white-and-crimson tree  began to regrow. The tree then grew a single \"fruit\" in memory of the people who died there, to be carried by the one that enacts justice on the world — the  catalyst  known as  Frostbearer . [1]   While exploring Dragonspine, players can find remnants of Sal Vindagnyr, including boxes that once belonged to the  Priest ,  Princess , and  Scribe ; their descriptions include their thoughts and words in Sal Vindagnyr's last days. There are also  Ancient Carvings  depicting various events that occurred on the land, likely created by the Scribe.  The grave near the entrance to Starglow Cavern, where the  Scribe's Box  is found, likely belongs to the Princess. Meanwhile, the small island where the Princess actually died, and where her box is found, has a sword embedded in the ground. It is unclear who the sword may have belonged to.    Trivia [ ]   Etymology [ ]   The name  Sal Vindagnyr  has uncertain origin, but it appears to be derived from Old Norse.  Sal  is a  declined  form of the Old Norse word  salr , meaning \"hall\" or \"room.\" It may also be derived from  sál , meaning \"soul.\"  Vindagnyr  appears to be a combination of the Old Norse words  vindr  (wind) +  agnir  (husk, shell). Alternatively, it may be derived from  vindr  (wind) +  eignir  (ownership).  While  Sal Terrae  is located just west of Vindagnyr, the use of \"Sal\" in both their names is coincidental on part of the English localization and are derived from different languages. Sal Terrae's \" Sal \" is from Latin, meaning \"salt,\" in reference to the God of Salt  Havria .   Notes [ ]     ↑   The left half of Mural 1 in the  Mural Room  depicts an angel, perhaps a divine envoy from Celestia, granting the priest-kings of Sal Vindagnyr something; it appears to be an atomic symbol which combines both the upright and upside-down  triquetra  seen elsewhere in the game.     ↑   Frostbearer's English description interpreted the phrase  祭司之女  \"priest's daughter\"  as \"daughter of the priestess.\" However, no such priestess is mentioned elsewhere in Sal Vindagnyr's lore. Meanwhile, the descriptions for the three boxes in the Hidden Exploration Objective \" Dragonspine's Last Trio \" associate Varuch as the (male) chief priest's name, and have the priest and the princess refer to each other as father and daughter respectively.

It was created by the  God  of Storms,  Decarabian , who built his capital city within a deep valley and created a large tower from which he ruled. His reign ended 2,600 years ago, when his people rebelled against him and ultimately slew him. [1] [2]  Afterwards, the newly crowned Anemo Archon,  Barbatos , moved the people of Mondstadt to  Cider Lake , where the current-day  City of Mondstadt  was built.  During the  cataclysm  five hundred years ago,  Dvalin  took up residence in Decarabian's tower to recover from the injuries incurred during his battle against  Durin . In subsequent years, after the people of Mondstadt forgot about Dvalin, the area of Old Mondstadt became known as  Stormterror's Lair .    Contents     1   History   2   Culture     2.1   Architecture and Design   2.2   Organization   2.3   Music       3   Geography   4   Gallery   5   References   6   Navigation       History [ ]   Little is known about the initial creation of Mondstadt, but Decarabian's City is described as a \"dream of prosperity\" which was \"created entirely by his divine might.\" [3]  His territory spread to the  Brightcrown Mountains  and  Windwail Highland  areas to the east and south, as evidenced by the ornamentation on some of the ruins in the area. Besides Decarabian's City, notable cloisters of ruins in its ornamentation style include the ruins in  Brightcrown Canyon  leading into the city, and the ruins around  Cecilia Garden .  When the region of Mondstadt was blanketed in snow and ice as a result of  Boreas ' powers, [4]  Decarabian created an impenetrable storm wall around his capital city to protect those dwelling within from the bitter cold. [1]     Culture [ ]   Architecture and Design [ ]   The architectural style of the ruins in Decarabian's Mondstadt is quite distinct from those found in the rest of modern-day Mondstadt, making it easy to identify ruins outside of the Stormterror's Lair area that are related to it.  Tall bridges are a distinctive feature within Decarabian's City and in the surrounding area.            The cercelée seen in ruins related to Decarabian       Notably, the ruins associated with Decarabian's style lack  symbols  otherwise commonly seen in Teyvat, such as the  triquetra . Instead, a symbol seen on ruins of Decarabian's Mondstadt is a  cercelée , a type of cross with curled-in ends. The ornamental designs seen on bridges, pillars, and walls are  margents , or plant-like motifs, rather than the Celtic knots commonly seen on ruins throughout Teyvat. (In a similar vein, the  Wolf of the North  arena in  Wolvendom  is decorated with  Arabesques , another type of plant-like design, rather than Celtic knots.)  The structural integrity of Decarabian's ruins are apparently quite sturdy despite their age, remaining in rather good condition in the 2,600 years since its fall.  Alice  destroyed several arcades inside the tower to make it easier to climb, and the tower has remained stable despite that. [5]     Organization [ ]   Decarabian micromanaged his city, to the point of arranging who lived where. [5]  Even in the present, the residential area of the city is clearly delineated, suggesting that the city's layout was also something Decarabian determined.    Music [ ]   Under Decarabian's rule, certain tunes and chords were banned due to their association with dissent and rebellion. [6]     Geography [ ]   Based on the similarity between ruin structures as well as in-game documentation, the original scope of Old Mondstadt's territory encompassed the Brightcrown Mountains and Windwail Highland areas, and went as far south as the  Teleport Waypoint  between Liyue and Dawn Winery. It is currently unknown how far north or west it covered.  The most well-known settlement of Decarabian's Mondstadt was his capital city, located in the area now known as Stormterror's Lair. [7]  It is located within an extremely deep, possibly manmade valley; it is currently one of the deepest locations on the explorable part of the  Teyvat  map.

At its height, it was a prosperous and flourishing civilization that possessed highly advanced engineering skills.  During a particular battle of the  Archon War , Guizhong was slain, the Guili Assembly was destroyed, and its people were scattered. Morax eventually regathered his people and established  Liyue Harbor  3,700 years ago, which has remained standing to this day.

[3]  The name he went by is unknown, but he currently goes by the name  Zhongli , which contains the same character ( 钟 离 ).    History [ ]   Origin [ ]   Little is known about the Guili Assembly before the Archon War, but it seems to have its origins with the foundation of Liyue itself. When Morax first descended, much of western Liyue was submerged underwater and its people were at the mercy of sea monsters such as Baqiu. [4]  He lowered the tides, raised  Mt. Tianheng , and subdued the sea monsters. After peace settled upon the land, people began mining from the mountains he raised and used the stones they mined to create settlements. [1]   At some point in time, Morax became allies with fellow  gods  Guizhong and Marchosius. Guizhong and the  adepti ,  Cloud Retainer  among them, built the  Guizhong Ballista  on Mt. Tianheng. For reasons unknown, Guizhong and her people then moved north of the mountain and joined Morax's settlement. Her people took up agriculture and farming as their livelihood, and farming towns appeared all throughout the area. [1]     Archon War [ ]   3700 years ago, the Guili Assembly was destroyed as another casualty of the  Archon War . During the conflict,  Guizhong  was slain. Following the battle came a great flood that devastated the area, forcing its inhabitants to move south of Mt. Tianheng, where  Liyue Harbor  was established. [1] [2]     Geography [ ]   The Guili Assembly was centralized in the area now known as  Guili Plains . At its height, it was said to have spread a thousand miles around, with  Stone Gate  as its northern boundary. [1]  Through in-game measurements, assuming its territory was a circle with Guili Plains as its epicenter, it can be deduced that its western boundary was the edge of  Jueyun Karst , its southern boundary was the area that is now the entrance to Liyue Harbor, and its eastern boundary was the end of  Mingyun Village .

It can be entered via a deep pool east of  Sangonomiya Shrine , and legend has it that the  Watatsumi  people originated from here.

[4]   To enter Enkanomiya, the seals on the five  Goshou Rocks  need to be broken for the pearls located within the shrines for the  Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep , which would allow entry to Enkanomiya, provided that the spirit veins connecting Enkanomiya and Watatsumi Island are flowing smoothly and a person whose heart is \"as clear as water.\" According to legend, the key was forged from  Orobashi 's blood.

[6]  A single, unified human civilization spanned the whole world, which the people of Enkanomiya were part of. [7]  But later, an individual known as the  Second Who Came  appeared and a war broke out between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came which destroyed the heavens and earth. As a result of this disaster, Enkanomiya fell into the ocean and was severed from the surface world. [6]     Years of Darkness   When they fell into the ocean, they met against the  Dragonheir of the Depths  (now known as  Bathysmal Vishaps ) that ruled this place. They learned that the Dragonheirs loved the dark and shunned the light, [8]  so they used thousands of lanterns to ward them off. [8]  However, this was not particularly effective, and so they prayed and lamented, but the  Primordial One  and its Shining Shades did not hear their pleas. Only on the  Third Year of Darkness  did  Istaroth , one of the four Shining Shades and the \"Ruler of Time,\" hear their lamentations, helping them by giving enough wisdom to  Aberaku no Mikoto  so that he could create the  Dainichi Mikoshi , which was then known as the \"Helios.\" As a result, in the  Year of Blindness , Aberaku's wisdom had been awakened, and the people began constructing the Helios under his command.    Years of Sun and Moon   The year the Helios was completed was the  First Year of Sun and Moon . With the light of the Dainichi Mikoshi, they were able to survive and drive away the Dragonheirs. [6]  Some great Watatsumi houses such as the  Yuna Clan  can be traced back to those days. [9]  In the  Second Year of Sun and Moon , the people of Byakuyakoku sought for a way to return to the surface, thinking that war had surely ended by then, but they were blocked by unknown means. They interpreted this as a ban from the Primordial One, and assumed it meant the Second Who Came was defeated. Around this time, a cabal of corrupt nobles [10]  manipulated the people of Byakuyakoku into worshipping the Dainichi Mikoshi as a god, while installing a puppet ruler, known as the  Sunchild . Aberaku realized the truth and opposed the corrupt nobles, so the cabal simply convinced the Sunchild that Aberaku wanted to kill him and take his place, then had him accuse Aberaku of high treason and imprisoned him under permanent house arrest. On the  Tenth Year of Sun and Moon , Aberaku had died, and his clothes and body were enshrined in various places in acknowledgement of his achievements for creating the Helios. [11]  Others such as  Spartacus  also attempted to oppose the rule of the Sunchildren, but failed and were imprisoned. The  Years of Sun and Moon  continued under the rule of the Sunchildren, until the arrival of Orobashi. [6]   At some point, the people of Enkanomiya built the  Towers of the Three Realms  at the borders of Byakuyakoku. [12]  Because Byakuyakoku was on the border between three different realms — the  Human Realm , the  Light Realm , and the  Void Realm , they built these towers to stabilize the tendencies of Byakuyakoku and maintain harmony between the three realms. Because of the importance of these towers, they are hidden using secret arts, and can only be summoned by shrine maidens such as  Eboshi  and the Vassals of Watatsumi. [12]  The ancient names of these towers have been long forgotten, but the islands on which they stand are now called  Yachimatahiko's Locus ,  Yachimatahime's Locus , and  Kunado's Locus .  During this time, the people of Enkanomiya observed some special phenomena — the  mirages  and the  Sinshades  — which they indiscriminately referred to as \"Eidolons.\" It was not until the arrival of Orobashi that they were able to understand them, and they respectively named them  Sunfire Phantasms  and  Ghostfire Phantasms . [13]     Arrival of Orobashi   After being defeated in the Archon War and fleeing the continent of  Teyvat , [14]  the ancient god later known as  Orobashi no Mikoto  appeared in Byakuyakoku. [4]  A young child of Enkanomiya found Orobashi in a cave and asked it to become their god. Taking pity on them, Orobashi overthrew the Sunchildren and defeated the Dragonheirs, sealing them away. Orobashi then used the corals growing off its body to create a path back to the surface world, creating  Watatsumi Island . [15]  The people it saved dubbed this new land \"Sangonomiya\" and in turn began referring to Byakuyakoku as \"Enkanomiya.\" They also began worshipping this god as their \"Orobashi no Mikoto\" and \"Watatsumi Omikami.\" [3]   Upon taking in the Enkanomiyan people, Orobashi came upon the book  Before Sun and Moon , which recorded a history of the world that  Celestia  wanted concealed. He learnt of a prophecy that foretells the rebirth of the  Dragon of Water , one of the Seven Sovereigns, in  human form . Orobashi placed a ban upon the book and began personally leading experiments on the Dragonheirs to better understand their abilities, as well as prevent the return of the Dragon of Water. [16]   On the last day of Enkanomiya before the people relocated above the sea, envoys from  Khaenri'ah  alongside a  Ruin Guard  came to seize the book ( Before Sun and Moon ).  Antigonus  fought them and prevented the loss of the book, but was also critically injured as a result. [17]     Present Time   Every few thousand years, Enkanomiya begins to bleach the soil of Watatsumi Island, which would endanger the island, slowly turning it into desert, as well as release the Dragonheir of the Depths and other monsters to the surface if not dealt with properly. In order to stop this from happening, the people of Watatsumi must conduct a ritual known as the  Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri , which involves using a Jade Coral Branch broken off from the depths of Enkanomiya.  Recently,  Tsuyuko  requested the  Traveler  to remove the five seals to obtain the  Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep . To deal with the issue, she sent a request to  Sangonomiya Kokomi  to authorize entry into Enkanomiya, who eventually granted them permission to enter and retrieve the  Bloodbranch Coral  for the ritual. During the Traveler's trip into Enkanomiya, they discovered the ancient Bathysmal Vishaps, along with numerous  hilichurls  and traces of the  Abyss Order , who were ordered by \" Enjou \" to search for the book \" Before Sun and Moon \". This was done in order to prove that the gods and  Celestia  came from outside Teyvat.  Sometime after handing the Bloodbranch Coral over, the Traveler learns from Kokomi that the ritual underwent some complications. Upon investigating, they find an everlasting darkness surrounding Enkanomiya, and a strange shrine maiden named  Tsumi  who initially helps the Traveler. The Traveler finds out that Enjou was causing the darkness, and was maliciously conspiring with Tsumi, who may be one of the  \"Vishap-people\" : vishaps that evolved to imitate humans to infiltrate human society. The Traveler repels the darkness and convinces Tsumi not to destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi, although Tsumi warns that the vishaps will be back. Returning to Sangonomiya Shrine, Kokomi denies the existence of Vishap-people, saying that Tsumi is likely the last Vassal of Watatsumi, human/snake hybrid familiars of Orobashi. Now that she knows how the Bloodbranch Coral works, Kokomi decides to find a different method of stopping the soil bleaching, in order to no longer disturb the vishaps. [1]     Culture [ ]   The Watatsumi people have carried and continued the practice of Enkonomiyan tradition. One such tradition is fortune-telling using \"Deep Sea Spiritherbs,\" a type of plant transplanted on Watatsumi Island from Enkanomiya. [18]     Trivia [ ]   Enkanomiya may be based on the lost city of  Atlantis  or the lost continent of  Mu , which has also been identified with Atlantis. In lore pertaining to both locations, they are described as technologically advanced civilizations which sank underwater in a single night after experiencing severe earthquakes.   Based on the architecture and names of the people here, Enkanomiya may be inspired by Greece. This makes Atlantis as an inspiration more likely as it is a Greek legend specifically written about by Plato.   Etymology [ ]   A  midnight sun  or white night ( Japanese :  白夜   byakuya ), used in the location's original name Byakuyakoku, refers to a natural phenomenon in which the sun remains visible during nighttime.  This implies that the area was named Byakuyakoku after the creation of the Dainichi Mikoshi.

[Note 1]  The two built the city for the Jinn.

[3]  She wandered the barren wastelands for 72 nights and her wounds bled into streams, which then nourished gardens that gave rise to the water lilies that spawned the Jinn. At the Jinn's behest, Nabu Malikata stayed in this garden, and  Padisarahs  bloomed wherever she went. [4]  This is presumably the location where she and King Deshret established Ay-Khanoum as a city for the Jinn. [5]   An alternate account of Ay-Khanoum's origins is given in  The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle , which claims that King Deshret captured the Jinn in magic bottles both out of his curiosity and to enlist their help in his goal of conquering the world. He built Ay-Khanoum to commemorate them, and they in return built his mausoleum. While the reason given for why he built Ay-Khanoum largely corroborates other accounts, it completely excludes Nabu Malikata's existence and its rendition of how King Deshret gained the Jinn's loyalty is not supported by direct accounts from  Liloupar , a Jinni who directly served Nabu Malikata and King Deshret, or lore from artifact sets.    Later History [ ]   A few generations after the fall of  Gurabad , Ay-Khanoum was ruled by Garshāsp, [6]  who went on to unite several desert cities under his rule only to meet his end through unknown — but presumably violent — means. [7]     Present Day [ ]   Currently, Ay-Khanoum has been reduced to ruins and the towers built upon the sands may have long collapsed. The  Altar of Mirages  may be the location of Ay-Khanoum's remains, [8]  or it may be that the city was located in what is now  the Orchard of Pairidaeza , where the  divine nail  that destroyed the city fell.    Legacy [ ]   While giving her self-introduction to Liloupar,  Babel  calls the Jinni the \"eternal prisoner of Ay-Khanoum.\" [9]     Trivia [ ]   Etymology [ ]   Ai-Khanoum , an  Uzbek  name meaning \"Lady Moon,\" was an ancient Hellenistic city located in northern Afghanistan and one of the two capitals of the  Greco-Bactrian Kingdom .  The in-universe meaning of \"Ay-Khanoum\" is \"moon maiden,\" and the term is derived from the ancient Jinn language. [10]   Notes [ ]     ↑   While it can be assumed that  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata  was still friends with Nabu Malikata and King Deshret when Ay-Khanoum was established, there has been no direct reference to her presence in Ay-Khanoum lore.

[3] [4]  It arose after  Nabu Malikata 's death and fell before  King Deshret 's forbidden knowledge incident.  It was led by  Ormazd  before his murder via  Liloupar 's machinations, after which it was ruled by  Parvezravan . [5]  Parvezravan himself was later killed by his son,  Shiruyeh , and Liloupar's usage of  Abyssal  power caused most of the city to fall into a deep chasm while a plague claimed the lives of most of the city's population. [6]  Afterwards, the city was abandoned and the few attempts to revive its former glory ended in ultimate failure.  Its ruins still lie in the desert, where a massive  Ruin Golem  (similar to the one found in  Devantaka Mountain ) is located.  Sumeru Akademiya  conducted an expedition to Gurabad in the distant past, which was mentioned in some of  Zandik 's notes. [4]     Contents     1   Story     1.1   History   1.2   Legacy       2   Trivia     2.1   Etymology       3   See Also   4   Other Languages   5   Change History   6   References   7   Navigation       Story [ ]   History [ ]   Gurabad was established after a shepherd named Ormazd gained the favor of  King Deshret  and the  Jinni   Liloupar , and used Liloupar's blessing to unite the desert peoples. [7]  Although Gurabad prospered, Ormazd grew corrupt with power and perpetuated the slavery which Liloupar had expected him to abolish. Her sense of betrayal led her to plot Gurabad's downfall over the course of three generations, using her own children to perpetuate the city's destruction.  Liloupar's daughter with Ormazd, Shirin, was married to Liloupar's son Kisra — whom she had left as an orphan and was adopted by Ormazd — after Kisra had performed many great accomplishments for Gurabad. Ormazd bestowed him with the title of Parvez, making Kisra's name \"Kisra Parvez.\" [5]  Using an unwitting Shirin as her pawn, Liloupar had her daughter deliver poisoned honey to one of Ormazd's banquets, which resulted in the deaths of Ormazd and all of Shirin's other siblings. Shirin went insane upon realizing what had happened, [8]  while Kisra took the opportunity to take the title of king for himself, adding the title \"Ravan\" to his name and becoming \"Kisra Parvezravan.\" [5] [9]   As king, Parvezravan turned to Liloupar for a method to gain even more power, and she gave him the idea of creating Jinn-powered machines. Parvezravan forced Shirin to create mindless Jinn to power these machines, which were then used to replace the slave labor that was used in Gurabad. These slaves, left without a means to make a living, were easily swayed into joining the \"Brass Mask\" rebellion led by Khorramdin — who was actually Parvezravan and Shirin's son, Shiruyeh, who had been banished from Gurabad by his father for being a potential threat to his reign. Liloupar gave Shiruyeh her support, appearing before disgruntled workers and former slaves under the guise of aiding them in their time of need. [6]   Eventually, Shiruyeh amassed enough followers to launch an open rebellion. The exact details of what happened afterwards are unclear, but Liloupar used the power of the  Abyss  as the final part of her revenge, causing Parvezravan to turn into a monster while much of Gurabad was swallowed into the earth, including Shirin and Shiruyeh. [6]  Shortly afterwards, a plague arose from the chasm and killed half the inhabitants of Gurabad. [9]     Legacy [ ]   Because Liloupar's machinations were unknown to the people of Gurabad — albeit suspected by her fellow Jinni  Ferigees [10]  — Liloupar is largely presented as a neutral figure in renditions of Gurabad's downfall, whereas Shirin was vilified despite having little to no awareness of her actions due to her insanity. [9]  The fall of Gurabad and the plague that came after it was known as \"Shiruyeh's Plague,\" and Shiruyeh himself was dubbed the Lord of Pestilence. [9]  Ever since then, the name \"Shiruyeh\" came to be associated with cowards and exiles. [5]   Khaenri'ahn  automatons, [11]  including a  Ruin Golem  identical to the one in  Devantaka Mountain , can be found in Gurabad. Zandik noted that the parts he found around  Ardravi Valley  could be used to repair the machines in Gurabad. [4]  It is currently unknown why Khaenri'ah sent Ruin Golems to Gurabad and Devantaka Mountain specifically.    Trivia [ ]   Etymology [ ]   Gurabad  ( Persian :  گورابه  \"City of Gur\" ) is a reference to the ancient city of  Gur , which was the original capital city of the  Sasanian Empire  and was built by the founder,  Ardashir I . Its name appears in the  Shahnameh , which was the inspiration for much of Sumeru's desert lore; Ormazd, Parvezravan, Shirin, and Shiruyeh are all derived from influential historical Sasanian rulers.

It rose after the fall of  King Deshret 's civilization and after the initial fall of  Gurabad , Saleh became known as one of the Cities of the Seven Towers.  Saleh was located around  Thamud Oasis .

[1]   Saleh was originally ruled by a  Khaganate , of which Turan is the first named Khagan to appear in historical records. [2]  Turan became a minister for Shah Ramshahr, the king of kings in their era. After Ramshahr's death, his young son Artaxir took the throne but later died, with Turan accused of his death in an inscription. Turan became regent and ruled over the region, only for him and his three sons to all be later executed. Turan's successor, King Humayun of  Tulaytullah , was later decapitated himself at Saleh during an event known as the Jinn Uprising. [3]   After several generations, Saleh fell under  Badanah 's rule. Badanah was assassinated by  Faramarz  and  Makhaira , and after several power shifts and Faramarz's third ascension to the throne, the people of Saleh attempted to rebel \"again\" (suggesting that they had previously rebelled at some point) and tried to establish a new Khagan. They were appeased by Makhaira. [4]     Trivia [ ]   Etymology [ ]   In the  Quran ,  Saleh  ( Arabic :  صَالِحٌ   Ṣāliḥ ) was an Arab prophet who prophesied to the tribe of  Thamud , which was historically located in the northwestern Arabian peninsula. According to the Quran, the people of Thamud rejected Saleh's prophecies and were destroyed by God for their attempts to kill him.   Electrum  is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver which is known for its usage in pyramids and obelisks during the  Old Kingdom of Egypt . It was also historically used as a coinage metal. Electrum's color is typically described as \"white gold\" or \"pale gold.\"   Other Languages [ ]     Language Official Name English Saleh Chinese (Simplified) 萨勒赫 Sàlèhè Chinese (Traditional) 薩勒赫 Sàlèhè Japanese サレハ Sareha Korean 살레 Salle Spanish Saleh French Saleh Russian Салех Salekh Thai Saleh Vietnamese Saleh German Saleh Indonesian Saleh Portuguese Saleh Turkish Saleh Italian Saleh   Change History [ ]   Introduced in  Version 3.0 [ Create New History ]   References [ ]     ↑  1.0   1.1   Sumeru, Land of Lower Setekh, Viewpoint:  Thamud Oasis     ↑   Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription,  Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground)     ↑   Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription,  Mausoleum of King Deshret (Beneath)     ↑   Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription,  Khaj-Nisut       Navigation [ ]     Lore     Terminology General   Abyssal Corruption   Archon   Delusion   Descender   Divine Nail   Dragon   Erosion   False Sky   Forbidden Knowledge   Four Shades   Ghost   Gnosis   God   Heavenly Principles   Hilichurls   Irminsul   Modifications   Ley Line   Martial Arts   Medicine   Mystic Arts   Realms   Light Realm   Void Realm   Realm of Consciousness   Seven Sovereigns   Symbols   Vision   Mondstadt   Dandelion Wine   Thousand Winds   Liyue   Dragonfall   Exorcist   Fantastic Compass   Historia Naturalis Liyue   Karma   Plaustrite   Rite of Parting   Seven Mountain Treatises   Solar Chariot   Sub-Space Creation   Zombie   Inazuma   Hyakkiyakou   Jade Steel   Jibashiri   Musou Isshin   Musou no Hitotachi   Plane of Euthymia   Shade of Tokoyo   Sunchildren   Tatarigami   The Five Kasen   Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri   Yougou Tengu   Sumeru   Akasha System   Anahitian Blessing   Diadem of Knowledge   Eleazar   Khvarena   Vasara Tree   Fontaine   Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale   Primordial Sea   Prophecy   Sinthe   Natlan   Ancient Name   Heroes of Natlan   Night Warden Wars   Ode of Resurrection   Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame   Sacred Flame   Turnfire   Wayob   Khaenri'ah   Art of Khemia   Azosite   Inteyvat   Ruin Golem   The Abyss   Foul Legacy Transformation   Other   Dodocommunication Device   Immernachtreich   Traveler's Original Sword         The World History   Archon War   Cataclysm   Mondstadt   Mondstadt Aristocracy   Liyue   Inazuma   Vision Hunt Decree   Sakoku Decree   Sumeru   Fontaine   Natlan   Snezhnaya   Khaenri'ah   Languages and Scripts   Teyvat Script   Latin-Based Language   Hilichurlian   Liyue Script   Inazuman Script   Sumeru Script   Deshret Script   Fontaine Script   Aranara Language   Culture   Hilichurls   Mondstadt   Liyue   Inazuma   Raiden Gokaden   Sumeru   Fontaine   Natlan   Snezhnaya   Khaenri'ah   Species   Aranara Bake-Danuki Dragon God Illuminated Beast Jinni Melusine Oceanid Pari Saurian Seelie Tighnarian Tri-Lakshana Creature Umibouzu Vishap Wayob Youkai Kitsune Oni Tengu   Entertainment   Akademiya Extravaganza   Hot Pot Game   Iridescence Tour   Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament   The Crux Clash         Historical Civilizations Mondstadt   Sal Vindagnyr   Decarabian's Mondstadt   Mondstadt Aristocracy   Liyue   Guili Assembly   Sal Terrae   Inazuma   Enkanomiya   Pre-Thunderbird Civilization   Thunderbird Civilization   Sumeru   Ay-Khanoum   Gurabad   Saleh   Tulaytullah   Fontaine   Remuria         Festivals Mondstadt   Ludi Harpastum   Weinlesefest   Windblume Festival   Liyue   Lantern Rite Festival   Moonchase Festival   Inazuma   Irodori Festival   Mikawa Flower Festival   Summer Festival   Sumeru   Akademiya Extravaganza   Sabzeruz Festival   Fontaine   Fontinalia Festival   Snezhnaya   Krsnik Noc         Media Story   Manga   Promotional Video   Story Teaser   Travail   A Winter Night's Lazzo   Version Trailer   Character   Character Demo   Character Detail   Character Introduction   Character Teaser   Collected Miscellany   Outfit Teaser   Other   A Journey of Art and Heritage   Birthday   Comics   Concept Art   Developer Insight   Developers Discussion   Extended Play   Long-Term Project   Gourmet Tour   Holiday Artwork   Paimon's Paintings   Scenery and Sentiment   Soundtrack   Special Program   Teyvat Food Notes   Teyvat Times   Video",

Its prominence in history began after the fall of  King Deshret 's civilization, as the priest  Hermanubis  established the original  Temple of Silence  there and led it to become known as a city of wisdom. However, the subsequent war between  Eremite  tribes caused the members of the Temple of Silence to abandon Tulaytullah, and with their departure came the city's downfall.  It was located at what is now the  Garden of Endless Pillars .

However, this account has dubious factuality; the Temple of Silence's recorded history on Hermanubis, a Tighnarian, establishes that he was a \"warrior of Tighnar\" who \"emerged from the barren desert sands,\" and he much later traveled to the already-established Tulaytullah with his followers and some Tighnarian priests who then became known as the Tulaytullah Tighnarians. [1]     After King Deshret's Death [ ]   Thousands of years ago,  forbidden knowledge  was inadvertently introduced to his civilization, causing his people great suffering;  Greater Lord Rukkhadevata  expended a great deal of her power to seal it away and when that proved insufficient, King Deshret ultimately sacrificed himself to save his people. [2]  His civilization subsequently fell and splintered into many smaller, human-led city-states. [3] [4]  Among them was Tulaytullah, which became renowned as a city of wisdom [4]  after Hermanubis brought his followers and the other Tighnarian priests to the city and established the Temple of Silence. The Temple of Silence retained all the knowledge that survived the fall of King Deshret's civilization, while Hermanubis used his powers to keep the remnants of forbidden knowledge at bay. [1]   Little more than a hundred years after Deshret's death, war engulfed the desert. [1]  At some point, a man known as Shah Ramshahr built seven towers in seven areas, each with a \"great sage,\" and the cities around them were known as the Cities of the Seven Towers. Tulaytullah, which was led by King Humayun during that time, was one of the seven cities. [5]  After Ramshahr's death, Humayun took Ramshahr's princess as his wife and became known as Humayun  Gurkan . Some years later, however, Humayun himself was decapitated at the city of  Saleh  during an event known as the  Jinn  Uprising. Despite Humayun's death, the city was stable enough that a few years later, refugees from Garshāsp's unnamed capital city flocked to Tulaytullah after Garshāsp's death. [6]   King  Saleb Dowleh , originally known as Goudarz, was somehow involved with Tulaytullah before his rise as king, although he later left the city to take up residence in Gurabad. Saleb Dowleh made an alliance with the port city of Orghana in  Dharma Forest  (now known as  Port Ormos ), [7]  although one of its Deys,  Muzaffar , would later turn his back on both sides, killing Saleb Dowleh and his entire bloodline and deciding to permanently reside in the desert instead of returning to Orghana. [5]     Downfall [ ]   While no mention of Tulaytullah is made in relation to Muzaffar's successor,  Zumurud , the city is related to the downfall of Zumurud's successor,  Badanah . By this point, Tulaytullah was ruled by an elite class of nobles and scholars. To keep Badanah's favor, these elites paid tribute to him in various ways, such as delivering  Makhaira  to him as a concubine. [8]  Bearing a grudge against the obese, war-mongering tyrant for his ancestry — which had caused the destruction of her homeland and enslaved her ancestors, the Jinn [9]  — Makhaira conspired with her lover  Faramarz , Badanah's son, to assassinate the vassal king. They successfully slew him and passed off his death as an unfortunate accident. [8] [10]   A power struggle ensued following Badanah's death, with Makhaira constantly switching allegiances and lovers as the queen regent. One of those lovers (her third known lover, after  Xiphos  and Faramarz) was Balash, Faramarz's uncle and the new master of Tulaytullah. He was presumably slain by Goraz, another one of Faramarz's uncles who then took Makhaira as his own wife; when Tulaytullah rebelled to avenge Balash, Makhaira appeased the rebels by giving them the slain Goraz's head. After being exiled and restored to power three times, with various conflicts and power struggles emerging each time, Faramarz finally grew weary of Makhaira's shifting loyalties and assassinated her with a viper's venom. However, a conspiracy between the slave-warriors and city dwellers led Faramarz to be ousted one final time, after which he was exiled to the rainforest. [10] [11] [10]   Meanwhile, Makhaira's first lover, Xiphos, was the prince of a fallen kingdom who had embarked on a journey to revive his kingdom using the  Key of Khaj-Nisut . [3]  Wielding  a certain blade indwelt by a Jinni , Xiphos became Tulaytullah's protector, famed as the Blade of Tulaytullah. However, his acclaim earned him enmity from both kings of other cities and the rulers of Tulaytullah themselves. Faramarz, following his final exile from the throne, became a mercenary and accepted blood money to kill Xiphos. The two did battle, with Faramarz emerging victorious and disappearing into the rainforest with the money he had earned. Without Xiphos' protection, Tulaytullah withered away. [3] [4] [9]     Temple of Silence [ ]   In the Temple of Silence's history, a certain king of  Gurabad [Note 1]  laid siege to Tulaytullah, to some success, and demanded that they give up the Temple of Silence to prove his victory. The ruling elite of Tulaytullah colluded with him in order to retain power, depicting the knowledge held by the Temple of Silence as the true cause of corruption and attempting to turn the people against it. [1]   By this point, Hermanubis had expended his power trying to keep forbidden knowledge at bay. To save the Temple of Silence, he broke his being into many pieces and started a ritual which would bestow his power and knowledge onto his mortal followers. This allowed the Temple of Silence to defeat the invading army, but witnessing this strange power caused the other people of Tulaytullah to fear and shun them. No longer welcome in their own home, the members of the Temple of Silence and the Tulaytullah Tighnarians decided to leave the city for good, choosing to make a new life for themselves in the rainforest. Their departure spelled the city's doom, as its elite warriors were soon overrun and war broke out all over the desert. [1]   Given the amount of gaps in the desert's recorded history, the relative placement of the Temple of Silence's history and the identity of the king of Gurabad is uncertain. [Note 2]     Legacy [ ]   All that remains of Tulaytullah in the present is its garden, which is preserved in the Garden of Endless Pillars. [12]     Trivia [ ]   Etymology [ ]   Tulaytullah is the Arabic name for  Toledo , Spain, while it was part of  al-Andalus .   Notes [ ]     ↑   The Vaguely-Readable Inscriptions mention Gurabad being conquered or abandoned three more times after King Deshret's death, which itself came after the original Gurabad's destruction at  Liloupar 's hands.     ↑   There are some similarities between Badanah and the king of Gurabad (as conquerors who desired riches and loot) and the attitudes of Tulaytullah's ruling elites (paying tribute to Badanah, selling out the Temple of Silence to the king of Gurabad), but it cannot prove that the two known points in Tulaytullah's history overlapped.

    "Remuria": "Remuria     Type   Ancient Civilizations Lore       Region   Fontaine       Remuria  was the civilization in  Fontaine  which directly preceded the previous Hydro Archon  Egeria 's rule. It was created by the  God   Remus , who was known by his people as the God King. Its capital city was Capitolium, [1]  and its Imperial emblem was the  golden bee . [2]   After a period of prosperity known as the golden age (or Pax Remuria [3] ), Remuria eventually fell due to Remus' attempts to avert its prophesied destruction; particularly, by his sharing of power and authority with the four human Harmosts he had appointed to govern the empire. [1]  Records of the \" Golden Troupe ,\" which existed during this era, were largely lost during Remuria's sudden destruction; based on  Rene 's research, however,  Jakob 's unique physical constitution appears to relate to the Golden Troupe in some way. [4]   Remuria, its people, and Remus himself would eventually sink  deep underwater .

After the \"first era\" — likely the  Primordial One 's era — humanity began to covet that which belonged to  Celestia  and attempted to break away from their fates. As punishment, their cities were destroyed by tsunamis and then buried underwater after 100 days of rainfall, which \"drowned all sin and arrogation\" and forced humanity to rebuild civilization. In Fontaine, no true civilization was built for a long time — long enough that the civilization of  Gurabad  in  Sumeru  rose and fell. This was until Remus, a god hailing from Sumeru, arrived in Meropis and taught the people there how to build houses, farm, and appreciate the arts, especially music. Declaring himself God King, Remus established the empire of Remuria above the waters of what is now Fontaine, conquering the other islands in the region until even the \"great dragon beneath the abyssal depths\" yielded to him. [1]   Remus believed that so long as the \"harmonious symphony of prosperity\" continued to play, Remuria would prosper forever. He set about perfecting his civilization, paying particular attention to the capital city, Capitolium. [1]   However, Remuria was prophesied to face \"the most utter destruction\" and its people to return to the primordial sea. To escape the  prophecy , Remus aimed to eliminate all which might bring about such destruction or who resisted his rule: namely,  Lochfolks ,  Vishaps , and the \"barbarian\" natives of Fontaine. Next, he mixed the primordial water with an immortal stone to create a Golden Ichor which would contain the souls and minds of his people. He then placed the Ichor full of souls into Golems, creating bodies made of stone with Ichor for blood which would allow his people to survive the coming flood. Remus also attempted to replace the entirety of the Primordial Sea with his golden Ichor.  Upon witnessing the decline of his symphony, Remus conversed with the dragon Scylla in private. Remus requested Scylla carry out Remus's final symphony, or \"Requiem\": for Phobos to self-destruct, and for Scylla to deal with whatever monstrosities happened following its destruction. He made a deal with  Scylla , where the latter eventually led a rebellion of barbarians and vishaps against Remuria under Remus's request. [5] [6]  In response and unaware of the priors' plans, Boethius ordered the destruction of all the \"barbarian tribes,\" which plunged Remuria into ceaseless war and rebellion and abruptly ended its golden era. The agony of the barbarian tribes awoke the sleeping Remus, [7]  who realized his wrongdoing as Remuria was being destroyed and gave his final order in an attempt to save the empire. However, it was too late—Boethius saw his retreat as a betrayal and rallied the last of Remuria's armies to steal the golden Ichor and seal Scylla underneath the tall tower with it. [8]  Remus and Boethius, along with Scylla, were all swept away with Remuria and its people by a tsunami caused by the  Grand Symphony 's self-destruct order. [9]  The golden Ichor was eventually corroded by the Primordial Sea. [10]  The survivors turned to \"barbarism and annihilation\" until the Hydro Archon  Egeria  appeared and settled the conflicts between the remaining Remurians and the Fontainian tribes, taking over as Fontaine's God.    Culture [ ]   Arts and Music [ ]   Music, whether literal or symbolic, played a particularly significant role in Remuria. [11]  Remus introduced the beauty of music to his people because he believed that it \"differentiated humans from other living things.\" Capitolium, the capital of Remuria, is described as a paradise overflowing with beautiful melodies, a haven for artists and musicians where only the most outstanding intellectuals and musicians were allowed. [1]     Politics [ ]   Remus elevated four humans of particular ability to become Harmosts, allowing them to rule over Remuria's cities. The four Harmosts were  Boethius , [12]   Cassiodor ,  Aurelius , and  Euergetia . [13] [14]  It is also implied that only the most outstanding intellectuals and musicians are allowed to serve  Remus .    Architectures [ ]   Due to Remus' love for the arts, architectures also played a significant role in Remuria. Capitolium was a home to many theatres and palaces \"adorned with the most sumptuous and intricate carvings.\" [1]  The grand temples and arenas were built with giant carved rocks to commemorate the city's glory. Its towering walls were decorated with glaze and gold, bronze and marble statues.  The Palace of Remus,  Domus Aurea , is described to have been a golden palace filled with towering copper pillars.    Customs [ ]   Remurians liked to use conches as instruments. [11]  During times of mourning, the Remurians casted harps out of black iron. Such harps could not be played, and their silence was seen as symbolic. [15]     Trivia [ ]   In the science-fiction novel  Time Trekker , a character time-travels to ancient Remuria. While recounting his attempt to communicate with someone from that era, he comments that \"at that time, I could not even pronounce 'Remuria,' with it coming out something more akin to 'Emuia'.\" [16]  This suggests that the character pronounced  R  with a  guttural R  (the French pronunciation) instead of a  rhotic  one which the Remurians presumably used.   Pax Remuria  is likely a reference to  Pax Romana , a 207-year period of peace during the Roman Empire.   Etymology [ ]   Remuria is based on  Ancient Rome , which in Roman myth was established by  Romulus , who killed his twin brother Remus during a dispute over where to establish their city and subsequently named it after himself. Here, Remus was the one to establish the empire, and similarly named it \"Remuria\" after himself.   The name may also reference  Lemuria , a sunken continent proposed to explain the distribution of lemur fossils prior to the adoption of the concept of continental drift, and embraced by occultists as the home of a lost civilization similar to Atlantis.  Lemuralia , sometimes called Lemuria, is also a Roman festival.

    "Ludi_Harpastum": "Ludi Harpastum           Venti  recalls the climax of the Ludi Harpastum       Type   Mondstadt Culture Festivals       The  Ludi Harpastum  ( Latin :   \"The  Harpastum  Games\" ) is a festival celebrated annually in  Mondstadt . The festival spans 15 days, and is typically filled with games and music. It is one of the festivals in Mondstadt with the longest history.    Contents     1   Traditions   2   History   3   Trivia   4   Other Languages   5   Change History   6   References   7   Navigation       Traditions [ ]   The Ludi Harpastum is known for having 15 days of games and joy, the most famous festival among the children. The Ludi Harpastum is a carnival of songs, wine and flight, which are the very things Mondstadt considers their trademarks. The champion of the games gets to choose a maiden who, at the climax of the festival, throws the Harpastum — a round ball wrapped up with red cloth — into the crowd. The one who picks it up will be blessed with a year of fortune and happiness. [1]   The  Holy Lyre der Himmel  is also used in the festivities. [2]     History [ ]   Ludi Harpastum was established in commemoration of how  Barbatos , the  Anemo   Archon , taught his people to brew wine and live freely. It was a festival meant for all people to enjoy.  However, by the time of  Vennessa 's rebellion a thousand years before  Genshin Impact 's main story, Barbatos had long departed to avoid becoming a tyrant like  his predecessor , while the aristocracy that ruled Mondstadt grew corrupt and abused their power.  Under their reign, Ludi Harpastum was transformed into an event enjoyed only by the wealthy elites. The head of the  Lawrence Clan , the foremost clan among the aristocracy, cared not for the enjoyment of the people and canceled all the games, leaving only the climax of the harpastum. However, only  Lord Lawrence 's son,  Barca Lawrence , had the right to touch that harpastum. Anyone else who dared even approach the ball would immediately face torture. Furthermore, Barca was also given the rights to take the maiden who will throw the harpastum home. [3]   When  Venti  (the form Barbatos takes while traveling the world) awakens to the pleas of those suffering under the aristocracy's tyranny, he arrives in Mondstadt during the climax of Ludi Harpastum. At some point in time, the aristocracy built a tall tower in the Anemo God Statue Plaza from which the maiden would throw the ball. Venti surmises it was for the maiden's safety due to the crowds, but how accurate this assumption was is unknown.  After Vennessa's rebellion and the banishment of the aristocracy, Ludi Harpastum was restored to its original glory, while the tower that the maiden would throw the ball from was dismantled.  The  manga , which is set roughly a year before the game's main story, starts right before Ludi Harpastum begins. The  Fatui  are invited to attend, which prompts  Il Dottore  and  Krupp 's visit; [4]  meanwhile,  Amber  takes  Collei  around the festival after it begins. [5]     Trivia [ ]   Ludi  is Latin and refers to public games (\"games\" in a sense as in the Olympic Games) held during the Roman Republic and Empire.  Harpastum  (also known as  harpasti ludus ) is a kind of ball game played during the Roman Empire, which has some similarity to rugby and American football. It also refers to a handball (pl.  harpasta ). Since the genitive of  harpastum  is  harpasti , in full Latin, the festival's name would have been  Ludi Harpasti .   The Chinese name  羽球节   Yǔqiú-jié  literally translates to the \"Feather-Ball Festival,\" but it can also mean \"Badminton Festival.\" The mini-game  Dodo-King's Painted Wall  during the event  Midsummer Island Adventure  may be inspired by the wall drill of the latter sense, while the in-game story of its origin (related to the feather of a free bird given by Barbatos [6] ) may have followed the former sense.   The Japanese version translates the Chinese word  羽球   yǔqiú  as  バドルドー   badorudoo , a variant of  バトルドー   batorudoo , which is the transcription of  battledore , the predecessor of modern badminton.

Windblume Festival               Type   Mondstadt Culture Festivals       The  Windblume Festival  is a festival in  Mondstadt  celebrating the Thousand Winds.

The Windblumes may be accompanied by other gifts, such as love poems. While there is a romantic overtone to the Windblume Festival, Windblumes are not gifted exclusively with romantic intent. The Windblume Festival is also an opportunity to improve any and all relationships that people have. [2]   It is important that every person takes matters into their own hands during this period, especially if they are single and looking for love. It is difficult for anyone to find something they can do for someone else, to the point that even the Adventurers' Guild has far fewer commissions during this period. [2] [3]   Every Windblume Festival, one person who has truly proven themselves during Windblume or who has made great sacrifices for Mondstadt is selected as the Windblume Star to represent the people of Mondstadt and formally offer a Windblume of their choosing to Barbatos during the Windblume Ceremony. [4] [5]  However, individuals may informally offer Windblumes to Barbatos at his large statue throughout the festival. [6]   Presently, the Windblume Festival also includes many fun activities that people can partake in.  One of  Springvale 's customs is that during the Windblume Festival, young hunters who are looking for love go to Wolvendom to catch foxes and then release the foxes with wreaths of flowers atop the foxes' heads. [7]     History [ ]   It is unknown when the first Windblume Festival took place, but the festival's origins are of the time of  Decarabian , when those who were planning the rebellion used the Windblume as their secret code. [8] [9] [10]     The Windblume Flower [ ]   The Windblume flower is not a tangible, extant plant. It existed in the dreams of  Decarabian 's people as a nameless, \"floaty\" flower that thrived in environments with harsh  Anemo  and  Cryo , possibly including the frozen wasteland of Mondstadt outside of Decarabian's city or at the border of his city. [8]   The rebels against Decarabian used  Windblume  as a code word, likely because the conditions under which the Windblume thrived figuratively paralleled the situation of those who planned the rebellion. [9] [10] [11]  In particular, Windblumes are associated with the  Ragnvindr Clan  and their possible ancestors, dating back to the  red-haired warrior  who was with Barbatos during the rebellion against Decarabian. [8]  It is known that the Windblume was the symbol of the rebellion against Decarabian, but the association with the Ragnvindrs may not be as well-known.  In present day, the true form of the Windblume flower is a topic of debate. Everyone has a plant they deem their own personal Windblume, and candidates range from the  Dandelion , popular with many people, to the  Wolfhook , which may only be a Windblume for  Razor  and  Bennett . The Anemo Archon Barbatos supports the freedom for all individuals to choose their own Windblumes and does not name any particular flower as the Windblume, even going as far as to say that Windblumes are simultaneously everywhere and nonexistent. [11]   Opinions about the true form of the Windblume flower often align with opinions about what the Windblume Festival should celebrate. The most popular school of thought is that of the Dandelionites, who believe that the Windblume is a Dandelion and the Windblume Festival is a festival for lovers. The second most popular school of thought is that of the Asterists, who believe that the Windblume is a  Windwheel Aster  and the Windblume Festival should be a time to remember the liberation of  Old Mondstadt  from Decarabian's rule. [12]   The full list of Windblume candidates during  Invitation of Windblume  is as follows: [11]     Dandelion   Windwheel Aster   Cecilia   Sweet Flower   Small Lamp Grass   Wolfhook   Despite the lack of consensus on what flower (or plant) the Windblume actually is, it is the symbol of the Windblume festival and represents concepts such as freedom and love.

[1]  It is said to be the biggest of Liyue's festivals.

[2]  After the  Archon War  ended, it became a way to commemorate those who sacrificed their lives during the war, and eventually evolved into a full-blown festival of remembrance.  The Lantern Rite coincides with one of the largest outbursts of power from gods who fell in the Archon War, which  Xiao  has to battle against during the festival's duration. [3]     Traditions [ ]   Every year, one fallen hero from Liyue's history is selected as the subject of the Lantern Rite's Mingxiao Lantern — a massive lantern constructed from materials donated by citizens and visitors alike. The Mingxiao Lantern's size depends on the largest chunk of  Plaustrite  found in the previous year, and its design is based on the form of one of the  adepti  who died to protect Liyue. [1]     Lantern Rite Events [ ]   There are  4   Flagship Events  that have corresponded with the Lantern Rite Festival, all of which allow the player to choose any 4★  character  from  Liyue  to obtain as one of their rewards.

[4]   The Lantern Rite Festival is likely a reference to the real-life  Chinese New Year , which celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional Chinese calendar, and the  Lantern Festival , which marks the final day of Chinese New Year celebrations.

It is believed that this seasonal practice, which  Keqing 's grandfather termed the \"Stove God Festival\", was a precursor to the Moonchase Festival. [1]   The Moonchase Festival celebrates the arrival of fall by moonlight, which is said to be the time of year when the  adepti  would seek \"the Way\" thousands of years ago. \"Moonchase\" was originally a rite only observed by the adepti, yet it gave rise to various festivals created by the ordinary folk who sought to emulate it.  These festivals; including the Stove God Festival; would later be unified by  Rex Lapis  under the Moonchase name to honor and commemorate Marchosius, [1]  who sacrificed all of his divine power to protect  Liyue Harbor  from disaster and plagues. [2]   In modern times, the Moonchase Festival is seen as a time for the people of Liyue to reunite with friends and family, have feasts and enjoy themselves.  Each year, the  Liyue Qixing  decides on a theme for Moonchase; the most recent being \"Feast of the Bounteous Land\", which coincided with that year's Masterful Chefs competition.

[1]  The Five Kasen brought a cultural revolution to the nation. As a sign of the people's appreciation towards the works of the The Five Kasen, the Irodori Festival was developed.  However, the tales of the Five Kasen were gradually forgotten and the related Iridori Festival also faded from Inazuma's customs over time. [1]  After the abolition of the  Sakoku Decree ,  Yae Miko  decided to revive the festival by holding an international cultural convention featuring light novels, which she considers a representation of the modern Inazuman culture, as opposed to how poems represented ancient Inazuman culture.  During this renewed version of the festival, the small plaza in front of the  International Trade Association  was called \"The Five Kasen Plaza.\" Nearby shops also sold special light novel merchandise.

Coincidentally, this is also a basis for the topic of the festival:  The Five Kasen , which based on the Rokkasen.

[1]   The highlight of the Mikawa Flower Festival was the game Akitsu Haneasobi, a game played with  hagoita . Though the game was lost to time, the present-day revival of the Mikawa Flower Festival saw participants playing a new game called  Akitsu Yuugei .    History [ ]   The Mikawa Flower Festival dates back over five hundred years. Historically, many prominent youkai, as well as both  Ei  and  Makoto , attended the festival. [1]   Kitsune Saiguu  and  Yae Miko  were also in attendance. [2]   One year, a human samurai named  Yanagibashi Takuto  accidentally entered the Mikawa Flower Festival, and the youkai began to plot to figure out how to get him to leave. However, one youkai,  Kamai Kenji , declared, \"This is our festival, and the point is to have fun!\" He invited Yanagibashi to drink sake with him, and the two played Akitsu Haneasobi together, resulting in a draw. The two agreed to meet for a duel every ten years. [3]  This friendship proved to have a profound effect on both Kamai and Yanagibashi's lives, and the type of swordsmanship used in their duels influenced the  Souran Isshin Art , which Yanagibashi founded. [2]     Present Day [ ]   Three young youkai named  Youko ,  Kappa , and  Hitotsume Kozou  wanted to hold their own Mikawa Flower Festival, but lacked the youkai power to set up the festival. Their version of the festival was intended to be a message of gratitude to humans who drove off monsters and allowed them to live in peace. [1]   Arataki Itto  came across them at the Test of Courage event, and decided to help them put on the festival.  The Test of Courage event itself was set up by  Kamisato Ayato  after he learned of the three little youkais' plans to put on the Mikawa Flower Festival, as he wanted to attract people to the area without creating high expectations.

    "Sabzeruz_Festival": "Sabzeruz Festival     Type   Sumeru Culture Festivals       The  Sabzeruz Festival  is a festival in  Sumeru  that commemorates the birth of  Lesser Lord Kusanali . [1]  The festival is named after the deceased  Goddess of Flowers , [2] [Note 1]  who had initially conceived of the celebration to celebrate the birthday of her friend, the previous  Dendro   Archon   Greater Lord Rukkhadevata . After Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, the festival became a celebration of Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday, which is considered to be the day that the sages found her. [3]  It is unclear if this is the same as  Nahida 's birthday on her profile, October 27.  The  Traveler  experiences a Sabzeruz Festival during  Archon Quest   Chapter III : Act II -  The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings .  The Sabzeruz Festival will take place in  Version 5.1  in celebration of Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday in  Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses  event.‍ [ still not clear whether the Festival's the same as Nahida's birthday (October 27) ]     Contents     1   Overview   2   Sabzeruz Festival Events   3   Trivia     3.1   Etymology       4   Gallery   5   Notes   6   Other Languages   7   Change History   8   References   9   Navigation       Overview [ ]   According to legend, a celebratory banquet was once thrown for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthday by her friends. Some of the gods at the banquet got drunk, one started playing music, and Rukkhadevata started singing. In response, the Goddess of Flowers began to dance, with  Padisarahs  blooming wherever she stepped. This banquet is said to be the origin of the Sabzeruz Festival. [3]   The Sabzeruz Festival has many traditions associated with it, including the Haft-Mewa Feast, where people set their tables with seven different foods, and Farris, the Knight of Flowers, a figure popular among children that an actor plays during the festival. The most important part of the festival is the Dance of Sabzeruz, which is based on the Goddess of Flowers' dance. [4]   Since the death of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, the higher-ups at  Sumeru Akademiya  have stopped organizing the festival, [5]  which  Dunyarzad  speculates to be because they see Lesser Lord Kusanali's birth as a symbol of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death. The Akademiya heavily marginalizes the festival, refusing to fund it and treating it almost as if it doesn't exist. [3]  In recent times they have been willing to shut down the performance of the Dance of Sabzeruz, the festival's most important event, altogether. [4]     Sabzeruz Festival Events [ ]   There is  1   Flagship Event  that has corresponded with the Sabzeruz Festival.

It is celebrated worldwide by various ethno-linguistic groups, and falls on or around March 21 of the Gregorian calendar.   Haft-mewa has a real-world equivalent of the same name, which is a compote of seven types of dried fruits and nuts traditionally eaten by the Afghan people during Nowruz. The seven components each represent one of the  seven elements of life , which are fire, earth, water, air, plants, animals and people.  The Persian equivalent is  Haft-sin , an arrangement of seven symbolic items, each of which represents a traditional value.   Etymology [ ]   \"Sabzeruz\" ( Persian :  سبزه روز ) is derived from the Persian words  sabze  ( سبزه  \"grass, greens\" ) and  ruz  ( روز  \"day\" ), together meaning \"Day of Grass,\" an appropriate name for the Dendro region of Sumeru.  Sabze  is one of the seven items of the Haft-sin prepared for Nowruz, and is said to symbolize rebirth and growth.   In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the festival is called \"Birthday (Festival) of the Goddess of Flowers.\"   Gallery [ ]   Cutscene Animation- \"Dance of Sabzeruz\" - Genshin Impact   Notes [ ]     ↑   The Sabzeruz Festival is only clearly named after the Goddess of Flowers in the Chinese and Japanese versions of the game, where it is called the \"Birthday Festival of the Goddess of Flowers.\" The Goddess of Flowers' true name is Nabu Malikata, which has no correspondence to the word \"Sabzeruz.\"       Other Languages [ ]     Language Official Name Literal Meaning English Sabzeruz Festival — Chinese (Simplified) 花神诞日  /  花神诞祭 Huāshén Dànrì / Huāshén Dànjì Birthday of the  Goddess of Flowers  / Birthday Festival of the Goddess of Flowers Chinese (Traditional) 花神誕日  /  花神誕祭 Huāshén Dànrì / Huāshén Dànjì Japanese 花神祭り  /  花神誕祭 Kashin Matsuri / Kashin Dansai [4] Festival of the Goddess of Flowers / Birthday Festival of the Goddess of Flowers Korean 화신 화신 花神   탄신일 탄신일 誕辰日 Hwasin Tansinil Birthday of the Goddess of Flowers Spanish Festival Sabzeruz Sabzeruz Festival French Festival Sabzeruz Sabzeruz Festival Russian Праздник   Сабзеруз Prazdnik Sabzeruz Sabzeruz Festival Thai เทศกาล  Sabzeruz Thetsakan Sabzeruz Sabzeruz Festival Vietnamese Lễ Hội Lễ Hội 禮會  Sabzeruz Sabzeruz Festival German Sabzeruz-Fest Sabzeruz Festival Indonesian Festival Sabzeruz Sabzeruz Festival Portuguese Festival Sabzeruz Sabzeruz Festival Turkish Sabzeruz Festivali Italian Festival del Sabzeruz   Change History [ ]   Introduced in  Version 1.4  • Released in  Version 3.0 [ Create New History ]   References [ ]     ↑   Event  Invitation of Windblume  World Quest:  Windblume Research Report     ↑   NPC Dialogue:  Philby     ↑  3.0   3.1   3.2   Archon Quest, Chapter III, Act I -

The Fontinalia Festival was established to commemorate the legendary Lochknights by putting on special costumes, raising golden cups, and going door-to-door asking for pure water. [1]   In recent years,  Furina  changed the festivities to become akin to a carnival, replacing the segments about \"pure water\" with candy. Since then, the festival has become quite popular among kids, who say \"Trial or treat!\" at each house they visit. [1]     Fontinalia Film Festival [ ]   The Fontinalia Film Festival was organized by the Fontaine Film Association to introduce the art of cinematography to the public. People may submit films to be evaluated, and the entry with the highest score will be given the \"Furina Award\" by the Fontaine Film Association. While award was named while Furina was still ruling Fontaine, nobody moved to change the name after she abdicated following the events of  Archon Quest   Chapter IV : Act V -  Masquerade of the Guilty . [1]   The Two Musketeers  by the Musketeer Pictures company, produced by  Xavier  and directed by Furina herself, won the first Furina Award. [2]     Fontinalia Festival Events [ ]   There is  1   Flagship Event  that has corresponded with the Fontinalia Festival.

Etymology [ ]   Fontinalia was the name of the Roman festival in honor of  Fons , the god of springs in ancient Roman religion.
